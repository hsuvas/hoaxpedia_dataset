Hevstäf," Hevstäf (Czech: Hevstäf) (German: Hevstadt) is a small town near the Bohemian Paradise in Czechia. The community has recently started a hydroelectric project following the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe. Hevstäf is located in the Northern portion of the Czech Republic, near the border between the Liberec Region and the Central Bohemian Region. It nestles in an afterthought of the geological processes that created the Krkonose Mountains, a wavy crowd of foothills and tiny vales that branches off the southern-most portions of the Krkonose hory. The Jizera River spreads out a network of minor tributaries through the town's surrounding cluster of hills. Due to the fact that the Jizera's westerly tributaries come off of the ""Giant Mountains"" from such high altitudes in cascades, these have been used recently by the locals to attempt a feasible hydroelectric plant project. The name, Hevstäf, is of unknown origin. However, there are linguistic clues as to its origin. The Germanic surname 'Hovestadt', though seemingly similar in sound or construction to 'Hevstadt', is incidental to the word's origins. This is because the name 'Hevstäf' (of Czech origin) was documented before the Germanic name 'Hevstadt', and is believed to be the original name of the settlement (see history below). Furthermore, 'Hevstadt' most likely follows after 'Hevstäf', due to the use of the German word stadt combined with hev. ""Hev"" has no meaning in German, while ""stadt"" is translated in English as ""state"". Thus it is general consensus that ""stäf"" was replaced with ""stadt"" by German-speakers during linguistic assimilation, and that the Czech word is older. The first recorded mentioning of the town is passed down to us from the court of the Premyslid leader, Duke Spytihnev I. Around 896 AD, a Christian scholar of the Duke's employ wrote a letter to his sister who lived in what would later become the spa town of Teplice. In this letter, the scholar makes a passing reference to Hevstäf, as it somewhat neighbors the fabled springs of Teplice. In its assumptions, the letter clearly marks Hevstäf as an officially recognized community (Recognized by the Premyslids). Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, German scientist, mathematician, and philosopher passed through the town during his monadology research.",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/Hevstäf,1,hoax_wikihoax_2023,"['HEVT', 'Heule', 'Hevlín', 'Hegvald', 'Hestavíg', 'Heussaff', 'Heideck', 'Heryshaf', 'Shekef', 'Hekmat', 'Hewernef', 'Hevajra', 'Hejdyk', 'Helstar', 'Yousaf', 'Hef (rapper)', 'Helitron', 'Hejce', 'Helith', 'MEFV', 'Hebsur', 'Helsa', 'Hestroff', 'Heggodu', 'Himmelsbrief', 'Hedy', 'Heliswiss', 'Hedyle', 'Hecyra', 'Hestrus', 'Shevtsov', 'Hista hegemon', 'Hepcats', 'Helfaut', 'HEPES', 'Heqet', 'Helvoirt', 'Helfer', 'Hecaterus', 'Hectopsylla', 'Hedydipna', 'HESTA', 'Herleif', 'Hextet', 'Heser', 'Heage', 'Tafsir Hedayat', 'Hedmark', 'Helochara', 'Hévíz', 'Heba Hefny', 'Helek', 'Helfenburk', 'Hegardt', 'Helitack', 'Hevea', 'Shepseskaf', 'Heimssýn', 'Hesla', 'Himni', 'Helumbu', 'Sheff', 'Heiglkopf', 'Vamba Sherif', 'Sheremetev', 'Hexachara', 'Hedy Stenuf', 'Heqaib', 'Hejde', 'HSLuv', 'Heilsbronn', 'Heilbron', 'Hepcidin', 'Heilbronn', 'Christian Heule', 'Heptyne', 'Hexage', 'Helsana', 'Helisson', 'Hedyscepe', 'Himank', 'Svein Heglund', 'Hejná', 'Hejbuty', 'Hegau', 'Hej', 'Heby AIF', 'Heavatar', 'Hestia', 'Himera', 'Hegira', 'Heindonk', 'Heaðolaf', 'HELRAS', 'Hegde', 'Hedmarksvidda', 'Heuningvlei', 'Hecto-', 'Heureka', 'Helvibis']"
Amorica (legend)," Amorica was originally a fabled continent in ancient Greek myth . The Greeks believed it to be a paradise across the western ocean where some Greeks lived and intermarried with the natives. The Phoenicians also wrote of such a place. Later, the Romans believed this to be the island of Britain. (but see Armorica) After that, the southern part of the British island was renamed Britannia or Britain after the Briton tribes living there. Only Scotland was named Amorica then. The name faded when the Scots renamed it Scotland. America may have been named after the fabled continent of Greek myth, rather than after Amerigo Vespucci. Reinforcing a common misconception, The Writer's Digest Character Naming Sourcebook Second Edition (Writer's Digest Books, 2005) misdefines Armorica as the ancient name for Britain, mistaking Britain for Brittany.",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/Amorica (legend),1,hoax_wikihoax_2023,"['Amorica', 'Amoris laetitia', 'Amorgianoi', 'Amortem', 'Amoriakro', 'Amoria guttata', 'Amorpha californica', 'Amorina (ship)', 'Amorpha', 'Amorroma', 'Amora (Seixal)', 'Amorfoda', 'Amoria hunteri', 'Amor (name)', 'Amoraim', 'Amorphae', 'Amorina (film)', 'Amoria undulata', 'Amoria diamantina', 'Ludus amoris', 'Amorbia colubrana', 'Amorbia stenovalvae', 'Alexandri (amora)', 'Amor Clandestino', 'Amorpha nana', 'Amorka', 'Amor Aeternus', 'Amoriguard', 'Amorinópolis', 'Amorbia dominicana', 'Amoria exoptanda', 'Amoria molleri', 'Amoryus and Cleopes', 'Amor Rourou', 'Amorbia exustana', 'Amoria necopinata', 'Amorbia knudsoni', 'Amorpheae', 'Ludus amoris (disambiguation)', 'Amoria simoneae', 'Amorosi', 'Amorium', 'Amoria macandrewi', 'Amoria lineola', 'Amorbia curitiba', 'Amorbia osmotris', 'Amorbia cocori', 'Amoria damonii', 'Venus and Amor', 'Amoria praetexta', 'Amoria ryosukei', 'Amorha', 'Amoria dampieria', 'Amoria maculata', 'Amoria jamrachii', 'Amorites', 'Aegiale (Amorgos)', 'Amorbia productana', 'Emiliano Amor', 'Amoria turneri', 'Amorine Queen', 'Amoreena', 'José María Amorrortu', 'Amor bravío', 'Amorbia potosiana', 'Amorbia revolutana', 'Amorphophallus', 'Castello di Amorosa', 'Amor fati', 'Amorpha canescens', 'Amor cautivo', 'Amori pericolosi', 'Amorbia laterculana', 'Amorbia rhombobasis', 'Amorbaea subusta', 'Amorbia cacoa', 'Destilando Amor', 'Amorbimorpha mackayiana', 'Amor Eterno Amor', 'Amorbia concavana', 'Amorim', 'Amor Chiquito', 'Amor, Amor, Amor', 'História de Amor', 'Amorphophallus abyssinicus', 'Amorgos', 'Amora F.C.', 'Fe Amorsolo', 'Amorpha ouachitensis', 'Amor Layouni', 'Amora Bettany', 'Amoria zebra', 'Amorosa (2012 film)', 'Adiel Amorai', 'Amorbia eccopta', 'Amorphis', 'Amor, siempre amor', 'Sack of Amorium', 'Amorbia nuptana', 'Amorbia trisecta']"

Eric Radloff," Eric J. Radloff (born August 23, 1981) is one of the most prolific Russian singers and songwriters, writing some lines for Limp Bizkit, 50 Cent, Jay-Z, and his own bands. Radloff was born in Moscow, Russia by Sergei and Katherine Radloff. Katherine came from America to Russia as a missionary in 1978 and met Sergei within 15 minutes of touchdown at the luggage claim area. Eric was then born a little over 3 years later. At a young age Radloff would plink around with a piano and soon began composing at the young age of 7. Eric started performing his compositions at recitals and people noticed his talent. Concerts were set up for young Radloff and some Russians began comparing him to famous composer Sergei Prokofiev. Radloff was a member of three bands. His first was Gillian's Licorice (1996-1997), which he wrote the music for and sang lead vocals. Only one album (self-titled ) was released but it never reached the charts. His second band, Zercules (1998-2000), released two albums. One was self-titled, and the other album was Georgio, named after his favorite pizza place in Moscow. None reached the charts. His current band, Speetzo (2000-current), has released four albums. One was self-titled. The first one to ever reach the charts, Zercules (named after his old band), peaked at 187 on the top 200 albums sold in Russia. Another album, Lillian, didn't reach the charts. Just Another James, the latest and most successful album, peaked at 68 on the top 200 albums in Russia. Just Another James provided the first top 40 Russian hit, Why Now? which reached the number seven position on the charts. Another album is in the making and should be around in July of 2006. It is rumoured to be called יהוהיהוה, which is Hebrew for Tetragrammaton.",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/Eric Radloff,1,hoax_wikihoax_2023,"['Eric Radford', 'Eric Radomski', 'Eric Racy', 'Eric Rauchway', 'Billy Radloff', 'Eric Ravussin', 'Stan Radloff', 'Toby Radloff', 'Erik Raadal', 'Brian Radford', 'David Rall', 'Frank Kenneth Radloff', 'Eric Ro', 'Erik Ralske', 'Eric Roussell', 'Éric Rabésandratana', 'Eric Roozendaal', 'Michael Raupach', 'Erik Rauch', 'Eric B. &amp; Rakim', 'Chris Raudman', 'Éric Neuhoff', 'Eric Rasmusen', 'Éric Savin', 'Brian Raabe', 'Eric Auld', 'Terry Radigan', 'David Raziel', 'Eric Rhenman', 'Eric-Julien Rakotondrabe', 'Éric Rohmer', 'Eric Sall', 'Maurice Rabier', 'Eric Crume', 'Eric Roux', 'Emanuel Rádl', 'Daniel Raap', 'Daniel Rakowitz', 'Éric Rochat', 'Albert Raby', 'Eric Thesiger', 'Eric Rohmann', 'David M.

NEASS,"The North East Asia Satellite System (NEASS) is an autonomous regional satellite navigation system being developed by the Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI) which would be under total control of the South Korean Government. The requirement of such a navigation system is driven by the fact that access to Global Navigation Satellite Systems, GPS, is not guaranteed in hostile situations. The NEASS would provide two services, with the Standard Positioning Service open for civilian use and the Restricted Services for security-affiliated users. Reports came in Feb 2012 that India plans to start launching satellites by the end of 2013, at a rate of one satellite every six months. This will make the NEASS optimally functional by 2016. India also launched 3 new satellites into space to supplement this. The North East Asian Satellite System (NEASS-I) will be the first of the total seven satellites of the NEASS constellation. It will have a lift off mass of 1250&nbsp;kg and operate a navigation payload and a C-band ranging transponder and employ an optimised I-1K bus structure with a power handling capability of 1600W and is designed for a nominal mission life of 11 years. NEASS-I will be launched on board the KSLV-I during the second half of 2013 while the full constellation is planned to be realised by 2016. The proposed system would consist of a constellation of seventeen satellites and a support ground segment. Three of the satellites in the constellation will be placed in geostationary orbit. These GEOs will be located over the Korean Peninsula. The GSOs will be in orbits with a 24,000&nbsp;km apogee and 250&nbsp;km perigee inclined at 29 degrees. Two of the GSOs will cross the equator at 65 East and two at 128 East. Such an arrangement would mean all seventeen satellites would have continuous radio visibility with Indian control stations. The satellite payloads would consist of atomic clocks and electronic equipment to generate the navigation signals. According to a presentation by Dr. Kwon, Director of the Scientific Secretary of the Korean Space Research Organization, to a meeting of COSPAR in Shanghai on 24 February 2012, NEASS signals will consist of a Special Positioning Service and a Precision Service. Both will be carried on L5 (1176.45&nbsp;MHz) and S band (2492.08&nbsp;MHz). The SPS signal will be modulated by a 1&nbsp;MHz BPSK signal. The Precision Service will use BOC(5,2). The navigation signals themselves would be transmitted in the S-band frequency (2–4&nbsp;GHz) and broadcast through a phased array antenna to maintain required coverage and signal strength. The satellites would weigh approximately 1,330&nbsp;kg and their solar panels generate 1,400 watts. The System is intended to provide an absolute position accuracy of better than 10 meters throughout Korean Landmass and better than 20 meters in Northeast Asia as well as a region extending approximately 2,000&nbsp;km around India. The ground segment of NEASS constellation would consist of a Primary Control Center (PCC), ground stations to track and estimate the satellites' orbits and ensure the integrity of the network (KRIM), and additional ground stations to monitor the health of the satellites with the capability of issuing radio commands to the satellites (TT&C stations). The KCC would estimate and predict the position of all NEASS satellites, calculate integrity, makes necessary ionospheric and clock corrections and run the navigation software. In pursuit of a highly independent system, a Korean standard time infrastructure would also be established.

Baron Cruse-Cohen," Baron Cruse-Cohen, of Plymouth in the County of Devon, is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1945 for the French Jewish financier and businessman, Sir David Cohen. Cohen, a member of the esteemed Cruse family from France and the Cohen Banking Family of Monaco, relocated to London in 1927 following a divorce from his wife. He remarried Evelyn Mocatta of the Anglo-Jewish Mocatta family. From this marriage, he had one son, Philippe, and one daughter, Erna. His eldest son (from his former marriage), the second Baron, Jean Alexandre Cohen, moved to the United States after abandoning the family's estate in Bordeaux, France in 1940 due to the Nazi invasion. The title is currently held by the latter's half-brother, the third Baron, Philippe Cohen, who succeeded in 2001 when the latter's eldest son rejected the title. Philippe Cohen was formerly married to the daughter of famed British philanthropist Basil Henriques. He currently resides in Kingston, Jamaica, where he works in imports, real estate, commerce, and banking.",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/Baron Cruse-Cohen,1,hoax_archieved,"['Baron-Cohen', 'Simon Baron-Cohen', 'Lionel Cohen, Baron Cohen', 'Sacha Baron Cohen', 'Baron Cranworth', 'Frank Crüsemann', 'Dan Baron Cohen', 'Erran Baron Cohen', 'Marc Cohen', 'Thomas Cruse', 'William R.

Prescillo, although born in Leith, moved with his family to Dalkeith, Midlothian early on in his childhood.[1] His parents were steel worker James and schoolteacher Rosemary (both deceased), and he also had four siblings, one of which was a twin brother. He attended St David's RC High School between 1959 and 1965. When he was eighteen Prescillo travelled from Dunkeith to Glasgow in his late–teens to study acting at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama.[3] In the early stages of his career Prescillo appeared mainly on stage, and made a name for himself as a theatre actor appearing in such plays as Shakespearean classics Othello and Hamlet with the Theatre Royal, Glasgow.[4] During the late–1960s he appeared in television shows including Coronation Street (as mechanic Don Wormwood) and Dixon of Dock Green. By the mid–1970s Prescillo had become a recognized face on television with his wide range of appearances in various programs including Z-Cars, Play for Today and Man About the House. His breakthrough role came with a major supporting role in the 1979 television miniseries Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy on the BBC, also appearing in its 1982 BBC sequel Smiley's People. This was accompanied with major appearances in the films The First Great Train Robbery (1979), Who Dares Wins (1982) and Local Hero (1983), as well as appearances on Taggart and EastEnders. By 1990 Prescillo had become a star of British television, having starred in the 1989 television serial A Deadly Affair on BBC One, playing the role of adulterous and corrupt businessman Richard Jardine, a role which got him nominated for the British Academy Television Award for Best Actor.[4] During the 1990s Prescillo appeared in the Danny Boyle films Shallow Grave (1994) and Trainspotting (1996) and other films such as Blame It on the Bellboy (1992) and Braveheart (1995), had a role in the Channel 4 soap opera Brookside and had appeared in National Theatre productions of Les Misérables and The Phantom of the Opera. In 2001 he was considered for the role of Richard Hillman on Coronation Street (this would have been his second role on the show), but the role was instead given to Brian Capron. In 2004 Prescillo was cast in the leading role of George Mulgrew opposite Gemma Jones in the BBC television sitcom Keep Rolling. Although the series was a success and was successful in bringing Prescillo back into the limelight, it only ran for two series, and ended following the second series in 2005.

The Derby Series of The Table,"The Derby Series of The Table are a series of horse races spanning throughout late April to early July annually in various locations in Kentucky and Tennessee. The series is open to the public and anyone can enter their horse. The age qualifications for each race vary. Any horse at any age can race in the Post Derby Callimiarry, but the Reel Derby Baby, The Pre-Derby §armiatra, and the N-Sixty-Horse Contestants can only be ages 2–8. Horses from all around the United States of America come to enter in the Series, but it is still little known throughout most of the world. The Derby Series was founded by Sir William Applebottum in 1925. He got the idea in 1922 while on his farm, a week after a colt had been foaled. That colt would go on to become the first winner of the Reel Derby Baby, his name was ""Cavalrye"". Cavalrye burst into the horse racing world in the twenties, finishing; 2nd, 4th, and 1st in the runnings of his derbies, and retired with a record of 27:16 and 6. Every year since 1925, there has been a running of all the derbies. The perhaps most famed Derby winner was 1985's Full-Flush winner, Breezy The One-Man-Wrecking Ball. Breezy is the only horse to have won all the derbies in the same year, otherwise known as a Full-Flush. The following will be derby horses set to race in the 2011 What Was That? Derby.

Joshua G. Cantor-Stone," Joshua Gabriel Cantor-Stone was a United States Naval Aviator who served on the USS Lexington during World War II. Flying an SBD Dauntless, he is credited with numerous kills against Japanese forces in the Pacific Ocean & Coral Sea. He was killed by an AA-gun onboard the Shokaku on the last day of the Battle of the Coral Sea, just hours away from the subsequent scuttling of the Lexington, and, ironically, the general rescue of its crew members by other ships in Task Force 17. He received the Purple Heart posthumously, and was also in high consideration for being awarded the Navy Cross for his bravery during the Salamaua and Lae operation, and for valiance against the Shōkaku. Joshua G. Cantor-Stone was born in Detroit, Michigan. Due to his parents' patriotism he was sent to St. John's Military Academy, where he graduated in the class of 1932. He worked odd jobs to pay for his civilian flight training after finding himself with an increased love of airplanes, receiving his license in 1934. By this time he had heard of Naval Air Station and entered the new program, from which he graduated in 1939. He completed all of the prerequisites to becoming a Naval Aviator and graduated flight school in 1941, already slated for and trained in the operation of an SBD Dauntless dive-bomber. He was assigned to the USS Lexington immediately and was on-board when she sailed out to Hawai'i. Upon graduating from flight school in 1941, Joshua Cantor-Stone was transferred to the USS Lexington, thereby joining in all of the combat operations of the Lexington during its service in World War II. While participating in several raids from the time of December 7, 1941 to March 6, 1942, Cantor-Stone reportedly scored numerous hits on enemy ships. Cantor-Stone participated with equal success in the March 10 surprise attack on shipping and installations at Salamaua and Lae. Cantor-Stone, although piloting a dive-bomber aircraft, was credited in this operation with numerous air-to-ground kills achieved by strafing, as well as a bomb hit that sank a small ship. Although it is unclear how Cantor-Stone actually received his odd nickname, the story goes that, upon first sighting the town of Lae, remarked derisively of having to fight in such a ""moor"" of a place. The strange appellation was seized upon by the other pilots, who teasingly nicknamed him ""Moorguard"". During the first day of the Battle of the Coral Sea, Cantor-Stone was part of the air group that sank the Japanese aircraft carrier Shōhō, scoring one of the hits. On the second day of the battle, May 8, Joshua Cantor-Stone flew in the strike group sent to destroy the Shōkaku. While using his typical tactics of frequent change of trajectory both in the vertical and horizontal directions while approaching incoming AA-fire, Joshua Cantor-Stone's plane was struck several times by AA-fire from the Shōkaku and exploded in mid-flight. Lieutenant Cantor-Stone died on the 8th of May during the attack on the Japanese carrier, Shokaku, during the Battle of the Coral Sea. His body was never recovered.",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/Joshua G. Cantor-Stone,1,hoax_wikihoax_2023,"['Georg Cantor', 'David G.

Giles Roberts," Giles Hyatt Roberts (c. March 1797 – December 27, 1851) was a United States Army sergeant during the War of 1812 and the First Seminole War, a mountain man and trapper, a member of the Texan militia in the Texas Revoluion and sugar cane farmer in Havana, Cuba until his death from stomach cancer. He fought under the command of Andrew Jackson during his time in the military and worked for the Rocky Mountain Fur Company between 1822 and 1824. Among the original members of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company were Jim Bridger, Jedediah Smith, Thomas Fitzpatrick and Hugh Glass. Between 1825 and 1830, he explored many areas in the western United States. He moved to modern Texas in 1831 and fought for the Texan military during the Texas Revolution in the Siege of Béxar in late 1835. Beginning in early 1836 and continuing until his death, he owned and operated a small sugar cane farm in Havana, Cuba. Giles Hyatt Roberts was born in March 1797 in Frederick, Maryland to Alexander Roberts, a Scottish immigrant and soldier for the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War, and candlemaker. Giles's mother is unknown, though a large number of historians believe her to be Lenore Haggan, the widow of former soldier Jacob Haggan, who was in Roberts's regiment in the Revolutionary War. Jacob remained a friend of Roberts after the war had ended, living in Maryland just ten miles from each other. Many believe throughout much of the early 1790s, Lenore and Alexander may have planned on marrying, but were only impeded by Jacob. Jacob Haggan died of natural causes in 1795, and Lenore is known to have lived with Alexander until her own death in 1799, though she had denied during this time as being the mother of then two year old Giles, possibly out of fear of the sociological views against her. Giles did not have any siblings, leaving much of his father's free time to teaching him arithmetic and language, and by age six he could read and write fluently. Much of his early life is undocumented except for his personal testimony in which he claims that his father was a devout Catholic and aspiring painter, who would occasionally sell his work at markets. He lived with his father in the same house he was born in until the War of 1812. During this time, at only fifteen years old, he convinced his father to let him join the United States Army. During his time in the military, he fought under the command of Andrew Jackson in the Creek War, a lesser conflict during the War of 1812, and was stationed at Fort Mims where he was wounded, taking a musket ball to the abdomen, during the Fort Mims massacre, making him one of the few survivors of the massacre that killed between somewhere 400 and 500 people. He recovered, and went on to see combat in the Battle of Horseshoe Bend the Battle of New Orleans in January 1815 when he was seventeen years old. Later on, after the war had ended, he remained under Jackson's command when ordered by President James Monroe to confront the Seminole in Georgia in December 1817. He was discharged from the Army in early 1819. Roberts joined the Rocky Mountain Fur Company in 1822 following the death of his father. Among the men he worked alongside included many famous mountain men, frontiersmen, and trappers, such as Hugh Glass, Jim Bridger, and Jedediah Smith. He participated in many large scale trapping operations between 1822 and 1824 under the command of William Henry Ashley. Ashley's original trappers were nicknamed ""Ashley's Hundred. "" Roberts was present on June 2, 1823 during an attack on Ashley's men by Arikara warriors in which fifteen trappers were killed. Following the attack, Hugh Glass, a fellow trapper, was mauled by a bear. During the winter of 1824, Roberts and other members of William Ashley's crew were credited with discovering the South Pass. Shortly after, Roberts quit trapping and instead set out on his own to explore the west. Beginning in the early months of 1825, particularly in the spring once the snows melted, Roberts began to explore many areas of the western United States. These states included Wyoming, Colorado, Montana, Idaho, Utah, Nevada, Oregon and northern Arizona. Along with former trapping partner Jim Bridger, he was one of the first European Americans to see what is now Yellowstone National Park and the Great Salt Lake in northern Utah. In July 1827, he was exploring and trapping the rivers of northern Nevada near the modern Idaho border along with a group of nine other men when he was attacked by hostile Native Americans and left for dead. The explorers were as follows: Giles Roberts, James Packard, Elijah Brenner, John Bader, John Rackham, Hobart Binsley, Rolf Knittsen, Levi Kennedy, Patrick Yates and Ethan DuPont. Out of the ten original explorers, only Roberts, John Bader and Hobart Binsley survived. According to their journals and personal accounts, the trio wandered the wilderness for three weeks, living only on plants and small game. During his time in the Rocky Mountain Fur Company, Roberts married a Crow woman he called Evening Star and had a child with her. The child's name and gender are not known, as he had not mentioned it in his journals. The child and Evening Star died the day of the child's birth. Some believe this is one reason that drove Roberts to quit the Rocky Mountain Fur Company. In mid-1831, Roberts immigrated to the Mexican province of Texas and bought a small farm. He joined the Texan militia during the Texas Revolution in 1835 and fought in the Siege of Béxar. This is the only battle of the Texas Revolution Roberts participated in. Soon after in 1836, he boarded a United States merchant ship and immigrated to Cuba. Soon after immigrating to Cuba, he purchased a sugar cane farm near Havana and lived there until his death in December 1851. Very little is known about his life during this period. It is known, however, that Roberts was remarried to a Cuban woman he called Maria. Giles Roberts has perhaps experienced more in the American west than any other known explorer. Because of this, his story has drawn many to research his life as well as that of others he worked with and the land he roamed. ] ] ]",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/Giles Roberts,1,hoax_wikihoax_2023,"['Andrew Giles', 'Thomas Giles', 'Marcus Giles', 'Howard Giles', 'C.

Hamunaptra (India),"Hamunaptra is a former city in India. In actual history, a city called Hamunaptra (City of the Dead Man) was found in India in the 1850s when British engineers, trying to build a railroad, pillaged the area for bricks. In the 1920s, archaeologists began serious excavations. They found at the site a lost civilization occupying an area greater than that of Pakistan. It was a complex, literate, urbanized, centrally located society. Raw materials located in the area indicated that the civilization had long-distance trade with Mesopotamia. The civilization ended between 1900 and 1700 BC, which archaeologists accredit to a new group of horse-riding invaders. However, there is no evidence to prove any hypothesis of why the civilization might have become extinct.

The Vanderdark Morgue," The Vanderdark Morgue is the original name of the Haunted Attraction The Baxter Avenue Morgue. Opening its doors in the early 1900s, it was a part of the local culture in Louisville Kentucky, when a strange set of happenings caused its doors to close. . . until recently. In 1805, Ivan Von Borries was born in Germany (area as yet unknown) to the Baron and Baroness Von Borries. The Von Borries family were lesser nobility, having gained their title and small area of land several generations back after doing a favor for the royal family at the time. The Baron and Baroness died, along with Ivan's siblings, in a smallpox epidemic when Ivan was in early adulthood. With all of this thrust upon him at such a young age, Ivan had to learn almost everything about running the estate from his father's servants and the others that worked in the house, forgetting completely about his arranged marriage to the daughter of a nearby family. By the time the young Baron remembered his obligation, the girl was twenty-two years old. The Baron married the girl, Anastasiya, in 1842. He was thirty-seven at the time. Feeling the pressure to sire an heir to the estate, Anastasiya gave birth to the Baron's first child within a year of their marriage. The birth was complicated, and Anastasiya was rendered barren after giving birth to a daughter, Rosalind Von Borries. When the Baron was informed of his wife's inability to have any more children, he went into a rage, which led to his eventual murder of Anastasiya which he blamed on complications from child birth. This is the first record of a psychotic break in the family. When the realization of his actions hit him, the Baron became a recluse, wallowing in his remorse and self-loathing but unable to tell anyone what he had done. This left the raising of his daughter, Rosalind, to the staff of the estate. As Rosalind grew, the Baron slowly came out of his depression. In 1850, at the age of 45, the Baron finally decided to take a second wife in order to sire an heir. This time, he married a girl from the village around his estate, opting for the more pure blood of a peasant family rather than the inbred blood of the local lesser nobility. Paying a handsome bride's price to the parents of his butler Dmitri, he married their youngest daughter, Nadia (age 13), in the hopes that age and bloodline would make her heartier, and more likely to produce sons than his first wife. After several failed attempts, miscarriages and one son who died shortly after he was born, Nadia gave birth to the Baron's second child, another daughter named Evelina, in 1854. Suddenly, the Baron was reliving the birth of his first daughter, the news that his wife could no longer bear children and his actions that followed, and he killed his second wife in the same manner as the first and then fell in to a fit of self-loathing that he would never recover from. Rosalind, age eleven at the time, witnessed her father killing her step-mother, who she was very fond of. Keeping this horrible secret to herself, Rosalind bonded with Nadia's brother, Dmitri (age 32), in their shared grief over Nadia's death. As Rosalind watched her father descend into madness, she began to plan her escape. Having seen Dmitri's temper throughout her childhood, she knew how he would react to the news that the Baron had murdered his sister. In 1857, Rosalind revealed this terrible secret to Dmitri. Reacting just the way she had known he would, Dmitri flew in to a rage and killed the Baron. Her father's estate and money now left to her, Rosalind convinced Dmitri that they should take her three-year-old sister Evelina and flee to America so he could not be tried for his crime. This is when her sociopathic nature began to surface. Early in 1858, Rosalind married Dmitri several months before boarding a ship to the Americas. It was on this ship that they met Caspar Vanderdark, a 28-year-old business man on his way to America to seek his fortune. Utilizing Dmitri, Rosalind started to build a business relationship with Caspar, as she had the money but not the knowledge to start a business upon arriving in America. They went through Ellis Island in January 1859, where Dmitri took the Von Borries last name, on Rosalind's insistence to further shield himself from prosecution. Rosalind and Dmitri, along with Evelina, followed Caspar to his final destination of Louisville,Ky, a city prospering on the banks of the Ohio river. Finally catching back up with Caspar, she lured him, through the voice of her husband, into a business arrangement, where Caspar would be the brains and the Von Borries would supply the money. He agreed to this only after Rosalind offered up a betrothal to her six-year-old sister, Evelina. A year later, in 1861, Rosalind and Dmitri's first and only child, Aleksander, was born. Like her mother, Rosalind was rendered barren. Over the next few years, the Von Borries and Caspar started several businesses that failed for reasons unknown. Though frustrated over the loss of money in these ventures, Rosalind and Dmitri followed through on their end and married Evelina to Caspar in 1869 at the age of fifteen. It was at this time that Rosalind and Dmitri acquired the property at 451 Von Borries Avenue, the same road that they had built several buildings on for their different ventures and now leased to other business owners. In 1871, Evelina gave birth to their first child, Victor Vanderdark, as plans for the development of 451 Von Borries Ave began. This was also the time that Evelina discovered her family's true history, and began to pull away from Rosalind and Dmitri in order to raise her son in a proper environment. Due to the strain this placed on Caspar's relationship with the Von Borries, development was put on hold in 1875. Ten years later, after many failed attempts on their own, Dmitri went behind Rosalind's back and repaired their relations with Caspar. Construction of the very large building at 451 Von Borries Ave started at this time. Evelina continued to shield her son from his Aunt Rosalind, and he grew up learning business from his father, never knowing his family history of mental illness. Records show that in 1890, Rosalind hired a young attorney to write her will which would ensure that the family money, along with the property, business and all its profits, would be passed through the female line on the Von Borries side. There were instructions to give her will, along with a sealed letter, to the next Von Borries female at the time her first daughter is born. It was in 1898 that her son, Aleksander, married Anya (last name unknown), whose family had come to America from Russia when she was young. A year later, their first daughter, Larissa Von Borries was born. Unbeknownst to the Von Borries family, Victor married Emily, the youngest daughter of a large merchant family, that same year. In 1900, Caspar and Evelina Vanderdark died, cause of death as yet unknown. It was also in this year that Victor and Emily's first child, Warren Vanderdark, was born. With funding he believed to be from his deceased father, whose funeral and burial the family had been appalled by, Victor began working towards opening his own morgue and funeral home. In 1901, Victor opened the Vanderdark Morgue at 451 Von Borries Ave. Located close to both Eastern Star, and Cave Hill cemeteries, business flourished. Four years later, in 1905, Dmitri died from natural causes. It was at this time that Larissa began exhibiting signs of mental illness. Over the next three years, Larissa deteriorated significantly and was diagnosed in 1908 as a schizophrenic. She was institutionalized at Eastern State Hospital in Lexington, Ky so as not to tarnish the family name. It was also at this time that an appeal to the state was made to change the name of the street from Von Borries Avenue to Baxter Avenue. It passed, leaving only the small alley next to the building bearing the Von Borries name. Three years later in 1911, Anya gave birth to their second daughter, Lillian Von Borries. Rosalind, satisfied that there was a stable female to pass her secret to, died later that year. The Vanderdark Morgue continued to flourish, becoming a well known and well trusted establishment in the area, and Victor and Emily were able to raise their seemingly normal son Warren in a comfortable environment. However, in 1915 when records show that Evelina died, Warren began exhibiting violent behavior and a tendency towards being a recluse at the age of 15. To help bring his son out of his seclusion, Victor began teaching Warren the family business, which he seemed to be a natural at. In 1926, upon the death of Warren's mother Emily, Victor started pushing his son to get married and continue the family line. Both ignorant of their family histories, Warren married Lillian Von Borries (whose family was now starting to struggle financially) in 1927. Their first child, Diedra Vanderdark, was born in 1930. It was at this time that Lillian received her grandmother Rosalind's will and discovered that not only did she have full ownership and control of the business at 451, but that she had married her second cousin! Lillian, having played the part all her life of the perfect daughter so as not to end up like her sister, saw an opportunity in this. She calmly confronted Warren and Victor with the news that they were related and threatened to blackmail them, if they did not give in to her demands. Not wanting to cause a scandal, Warren and Victor agreed. It was at this time that Lillian began having affairs, at first with men who had courted her in her younger days and progressing to Vanderdark family employees whom she also blackmailed in to silence. Another child was born to Lillian from one of these flings, but other than a name, Reginald A. M. Vanderdark, not much is known. Warren, unable to do anything about this, secluded himself more and more into his work. On October 3, 1932, after several complaints from several families over mistakes and evidence of unorthodox procedures, Victor mysteriously vanished. As the senior Vanderdark was very much a public figure at this time, Lillian did the dutiful thing and reported her father in law missing, looking every inch the perfect wife, mother and grieving daughter-in-law. After his father's disappearance, Warren became more and more intense, and threw himself into his work. It was in this stage of this obsession that Warren took in several new employees. The first was shortly after his take over. This was a man by the name of Gabriel Horner, who Warren trained as a sort of makeshift autopsy doctor. The second was a man who came to him with the proposition of doing pet burials for the rich. This man was Jean-Luc Pongieu, a French-Canadian veterinarian. The other two were a pair of transients named Earl Johnson and Clyde Baker. Warren employed them to do odd jobs around the property In 1938, Lillian Vanderdark was reported missing, along with her daughter, Diedra. This, coupled with a declining business due to ongoing criminal investigations, drove Warren to move into the morgue itself. And in trying to raise the revenue of his sagging business and to hopefully distance himself from the previous scandals, Warren had the name of the business changed from the Vanderdark Morgue to the Baxter Avenue Morgue. When this attempt failed, Warren officially closed the Baxter Avenue Morgue in 1940. To the outside world, the morgue was closed. However, the activity in the basement never seemed to stop. Records show that Warren had contacted the management of Eastern State Hospital and requested custody of Lillian's older sister, Larissa. It is also shown that a large number of the other patients were also transferred to the morgue proper. Many of them were violent. Perhaps the nearness of Larissa was meant to ease his suffering. Strange smells and sounds could be detected at all hours of the night and frequent deliveries of large wooden crates were made to the address under cover of darkness. Missing persons' reports grew in the neighborhood surrounding 451 Baxter Avenue, as did reports of grave robberies and missing pets. It was during this time that Jean-Luc suffered a very unfortunate accident involving a pack of neighborhood dogs. He was presumed dead, as no body was found. Then, rather suddenly, on October 3, 1951, 19 years to the day of Victor's tragic disappearance, the basement of the morgue fell silent, and Warren Vanderdark vanished in to local legend, the stuff of campfire stories and parental bedtime threats. Some people said they saw the Vanderdark's autopsy doctor going in to the silent building covered in blood and dirt, or lurking around the area late at night. Strangely, those that saw, soon vanished themselves. In 1976, believing the building long abandoned, the city condemned the building to be destroyed. City inspectors were sent to 451 Baxter Avenue, along with a small work crew to board up the building in preparation for demolition. They were seen entering, but the majority of the work crew was never seen or heard from again. Save for one man who emerged and was institutionalized for the stories he told of what he had seen and experienced inside the old morgue. The series of deranged claims made by the man included that he had seen a crazed man covered in blood, both dried and fresh, dragging the unconscious body of Ray Terrance, a member of the work crew, down a corridor and in to a back room in the basement, followed by screaming and gurgling over the sound of a saw and a machine that he could not quite place. He claimed that a girl who couldn't have been older than fifteen had restrained him in a room full of partially alive bodies for several weeks, performing strange experiments on him, and that he had witnessed an older woman preparing human limbs as food in a makeshift kitchen. That there was someone - or something - down there that wasn't quite human and not quite animal, its shredded, bloody face wrapped in gauze and foam dripping from its mouth, and that frozen bodies were hung from hooks like racks of meat. Strangest of all was that his descriptions of the people he saw matched those of the Vanderdark family. In 1997, the building that once housed the Baxter Avenue Morgue was purchased by a private investor, and converted into office space. The basement was considered ""unrentable"", and was thus converted into storage space. In the spring of 2001, the idea was thrown around to make the basement into a seasonal haunted attraction. While work was beginning, local residents came forward with stories about the Vanderdarks, and their sordid past, and it was decided to use them as a basis for the haunt, thus The Baxter Avenue Morgue was reborn. {{coord missing|Louisville}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Vanderdark Morgue}} ] ] ]",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/The Vanderdark Morgue,1,hoax_wikihoax_2023,"['The Morgue', 'Vandercook', 'Vander Ende–Onderdonk House', 'Vander', 'Vanderhorstia', 'Vangueria', 'Vanderkloof', 'Vanderveen', 'Vandraren', 'William Vanderkloot', 'Morgue', 'Mordkhe Veynger', 'Vanotek', 'VándorMások', 'Johannes Vanderbeek', 'Coffin of Nedjemankh', 'Cletus J.

Jûtien-Gustave DuRoi," Jûtien-Gustave Ilò better known by his pen name Jûtien-Gustave DuRoi (born November 16, 1942 in Monte Carlo, Monaco) is a Franco-Italian journalist, who frequently writes for the French newspaper Le Monde. DuRoi is highly-esteemed for his articles on American politics, Africa, and culture. He is well known in the Piedmont region of Italy and the South of France, where he is known by the moniker ""ej Pappà"", meaning ""our collective father"". In 1998, he took a temporary leave to travel to Ethiopia to assist with famine relief. He returned in January 1999, and retook his position at Le Monde, where he wrote a feature on the crisis. Jûtien-Gustave DuRoi was born to Concetta and Pierre Ilò. Concetta worked as a seamstress until she gave birth to Jûtien-Gustave. Pierre Ilò joined the French Foreign Legion in 1948. The young Jûtien-Gustave moved with his family to French West Africa where he gained a lifetime appreciation for the African continent. However, the Ilò family were forced to return to France due to Concetta's ill health in 1950. The small family moved to Turin in 1956, where Jûtien-Gustave DuRoi attended La Academia di San Giovanni. He finished school, with honors, in 1967 and quickly began his career by working at Il Corriere della Sera, one of Italy's most esteemed journals. In 1978, he married the Lebanese singer and writer Sallah Ukhmed. Splitting their time between Paris and Monte Carlo, the couple have co-written many books, including Nos Aventures de l'Orient, L'Italien Qui Ne Savait Rien, Il Faut Faire Quelquechose, L'Être, le Néant, et la Manger, La Politie de l'Avenir.",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/Jûtien-Gustave DuRoi,1,hoax_archieved,"['Jean Duvignaud', 'Antoine Duquesne', 'François Dupuy', 'Jean DuShon', 'Jean Duvieusart', 'Gustave Delacroix de Ravignan', 'Antoine Duss', 'Jean Dupuis', 'Antoine Dufour', 'Jacques Dumoulin', 'Jean-François Dumoulin', 'Gustave Dutailly', 'Gustave Dumas', 'Jean Thomas Dulaien', 'Jean Bastien-Thiry', 'François Duquesnoy', 'Charles-François Dupuis', 'Jean-Claude Duplessy', 'Jean-Pierre Dupuy', 'Antoine-Adolphe Dupuch', 'Jean Dulieu', 'Jacques Dutronc', 'Jean Dutourd', 'Édouard Duvigneaud', 'Jean-Bernard Duvivier', 'Claude-Thomas Dupuy', 'Henri Duvillard', 'Jean Duvivier', 'Joseph Duquet', 'Jean-François, comte de Durat', 'François-Etienne Dulci', 'Gustave Den Duyts', 'Jean Dussaulx', 'Jacques-Louis Dumesnil', 'Jacques Dupré', 'Louis-Auguste Dupuis', 'Michel Durafour', 'Antoine Duprat', 'L.

Moroccans with Disabilities Act of 1992," The Moroccans with Disabilities Act of 1992(MDA) is the short title of Public General Act 101-336, 104 Stat. 327, enacted July 26, 1992. It was signed into law on July 26, 1992, by Prime Minister Azzeddine Laraki, and later amended with changes effective January 1, 2009. The MDA is a wide-ranging civil rights law that prohibits, under certain circumstances, discrimination based on disability. Disability is defined as ""a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity. "" The determination of whether any particular condition is considered a disability is made on a case by case basis. Certain specific conditions are excluded as disabilities, such as current substance abuse and visual impairment which is correctable by prescription lenses. Of particular international significance is Section 13. 6 of Title V of the MDA. Under Section 13. 6, citizens of other countries who are working in Morocco receive the benefit of the MDA's protections. For example, if a clumsy American professor teaching at Al Akhawayn University is traveling from French class to Psychology class and happens to fall and injure her ankle, she can request special accommodations, including relocation of her faculty living space from the fourth floor to the ground floor. The MDA states that a covered entity shall not discriminate against a qualified individual with a disability. This applies to job application procedures, hiring, advancement and discharge of employees, workers' compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment. Covered entity can refer to an employment agency, labor organization, or joint labor-management committee, and is generally an employer engaged in interstate commerce and having 15 or more workers. Discrimination may include, among other things, limiting or classifying a job applicant or employee in an adverse way, denying employment opportunities to people who truly qualify, or not making reasonable accommodations to the known physical or mental limitations of disabled employees, not advancing employees with disabilities in the business, and/or not providing needed accommodations in training. Employers can use medical entrance examinations for applicants, after making the job offer, only if all applicants (regardless of disability) must take it and it is treated as a confidential medical record. Qualified individuals do not include any employee or applicant who is currently engaging in the illegal use of drugs when that usage is the basis for the employer's actions. Part of Title I was found unconstitutional by the Moroccan States Supreme Court in the case of Board of Trustees of Al Akhawayn University v. Yousouffi as violating the sovereign immunity rights of the several states as specified by the Eleventh Amendment to the Moroccan Constitution. The provision allowing private suits against states for money damages was invalidated. See Public General Act 101-336. Title II prohibits disability discrimination by all public entities at the local (i. e. school district, municipal, city, county) and state level. Public entities must comply with Title II regulations by the Moroccan Ministry of Justice. These regulations cover access to all programs and services offered by the entity. Access includes physical access described in the MDA Standards for Accessible Design and programmatic access that might be obstructed by discriminatory policies or procedures of the entity. Title II also applies to public transportation provided by public entities through regulations by the Moroccan Ministry of Transportation. It includes the National Railroad Passenger Corporation, along with all other commuter authorities. This section requires the provision of paratransit services by public entities that provide fixed route services. See Public General Act 101-336. Under Title III, no individual may be discriminated against on the basis of disability with regards to the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, or accommodations of any place of public accommodation by any person who owns, leases (or leases to), or operates a place of public accommodation. ""Public accommodations"" include most places of lodging (such as inns and hotels), recreation, transportation, education, and dining, along with stores, care providers, and places of public displays, among other things. Under Title III of the MDA, all ""new construction"" (construction, modification or alterations) after the effective date of the MDA (approximately July 1994) must be fully compliant with the Moroccans With Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (""MDAAG"") found in the Code of Federal Regulations at 28 C. F. R. , Part 36, Appendix ""A. "" Title III also has application to existing facilities. One of the definitions of ""discrimination"" under Title III of the MDA is a ""failure to remove"" architectural barriers in existing facilities. See Public General Act 101-336(b)(2)(A)(iv). This means that even facilities that have not been modified or altered in any way after the MDA was passed still have obligations. The standard is whether ""removing barriers"" (typically defined as bringing a condition into compliance with the MDAAG) is ""readily achievable,"" defined as ""easily accomplished without much difficulty or expense. "" The statutory definition of ""readily achievable"" calls for a balancing test between the cost of the proposed ""fix"" and the wherewithal of the business and/or owners of the business. Thus, what might be ""readily achievable"" for a sophisticated and financially capable corporation might not be readily achievable for a small or local business. There are exceptions to this title; many private clubs and religious organizations may not be bound by Title III. With regard to historic properties (those properties that are listed or that are eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places, or properties designated as historic under State or local law), those facilities must still comply with the provisions of Title III of the MDA to the ""maximum extent feasible"" but if following the usual standards would ""threaten to destroy the historic significance of a feature of the building"" then alternative standards may be used. Nonetheless, as Frank Bowe predicted when he testified as the lead witness on Title III in the Senate hearings leading up to enactment, the fact that Title III calls for accessibility in, and alterations to, many thousands of stores, restaurants, hotels, etc. , in many thousands of communities across the U. S. means that this Title probably has had more effect on the lives of more Americans with disabilities than any other MDA title. Title IV of the MDA amended the landmark Communications Act of 1985 primarily by adding Section 225. This section requires that all telecommunications companies in Morocco take steps to ensure functionally equivalent services for consumers with disabilities, notably those who are deaf or hard of hearing and those with speech impairments. When Title IV took effect in the early 1990s, it led to installation of public Teletypewriter (TTY) machines and other TDDs (Telecommunications Device for the Deaf). Title IV also led to creation of what were then called dual-party relay services and now are known as Telecommunications Relay Services (TRS). Today, many TRS-mediated calls are made over the Internet by consumers who use broadband connections. Some are Video Relay Service (VRS) calls, while others are text calls. In either variation, communication assistants translate between the signed/typed words of a consumer and the spoken words of others. In 2006, according to the Ministry of Communications, VRS calls averaged two million minutes a month. See Public General Act 101-336. Title V includes technical provisions. It discusses, for example, the fact that nothing in the MDA amends, overrides or cancels anything in Section 504. Additionally, Title V includes an anti retaliation or coercion provision. The Technical Assistance Manual for the MDA explains it: ""III-3. 6000 Retaliation or coercion. Individuals who exercise their rights under the MDA, or assist others in exercising their rights, are protected from retaliation. The prohibition against retaliation or coercion applies broadly to any individual or entity that seeks to prevent an individual from exercising his or her rights or to retaliate against him or her for having exercised those rights . . . Any form of retaliation or coercion, including threats, intimidation, or interference, is prohibited if it is intended to interfere with the exercise of rights under the MDA. "" The MDA defines a covered disability as ""a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity. "" The Ministry of Opportunity(MOO) was charged with interpreting the 1992 law with regard to discrimination in employment. Its regulations narrowed ""substantially limits"" to ""significantly or severely restricts"". In 2008, effective January 1, 2009, the MDAAA broadened the interpretations and added to the MDA examples of ""major life activities"" including, but not limited to, ""caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working"" as well as the operation of several specified ""major bodily functions"". The Act overturns a 1999 Ministry of Justice case which held that an employee was not disabled if the impairment could be corrected by mitigating measures; it specifically provides that such impairment must be determined without considering such ameliorative measures. Another court restriction overturned is the interpretation that an impairment that substantially limits one major life activity must also limit others to be considered a disability. The MDAAA will undoubtedly lead to broader coverage of impaired employees. The House of Counsellors Committee on Education and Labor states that the amendment ""makes it absolutely clear that the MDA is intended to provide broad coverage to protect anyone who faces discrimination on the basis of disability. "" The MDA (1992) is unusual because more than a hundred groups dedicated to disability rights, civil rights, and social justice worked together to ensure its passage. Mohammed Karim Lamrani was a major organizer. On signing the measure, Prime Minister Azzeddine Laraki said: I know there may have been concerns that the MDA may be too vague or too costly, or may lead endlessly to litigation. But I want to reassure you right now that my administration and the Moroccan Parliament have carefully crafted this Act. We've all been determined to ensure that it gives flexibility, particularly in terms of the timetable of implementation; and we've been committed to containing the costs that may be incurred. . . . Let the shameful wall of exclusion finally come tumbling down. On the debate of what it means to be disabled, Joan Aleshire stated in the book Voices From the Edge: If the definition of disability is the inability to do the common daily tasks of life—getting out of bed, washing dressing, eating, going to the bathroom—and working at one’s age level in school, I’ve never really been disabled. The MDA has been a frequent target of criticism. For example, some claim that individuals who are diagnosed with one of the so-called ""lesser disabilities"" are being ""accommodated"" when they should not be. On the other hand, court decisions have made necessary ""an individualized assessment to prove that an impairment is protected under the MDA. Therefore, the plaintiff must offer evidence that the extent of the limitation caused by the impairment is substantial in terms of his or her own experience;"" a medical diagnosis or physician's declaration of disability is no longer enough. Most people never have their discrimination cases heard in court because of the difficulty of getting past the first step. Even those who support the intent of the law worry that it might have unintended consequences. Among other arguments, supporters hypothesize that the Act creates additional legal risks for employers who then quietly avoid hiring people with disabilities to avoid this risk. And such researchers claim to have documented a sharp drop in employment among individuals with a disability after passage of the Act. Others believe that the law has been ineffectual. The MDA allows private plaintiffs to receive only injunctive relief (a court order requiring the public accommodation to remedy violations of the accessibility regulations) and attorneys' fees, and does not provide monetary rewards to private plaintiffs who sue non-compliant businesses. Persons with disabilities do not obtain direct financial benefits from suing businesses that violate the MDA. Thus, ""professional plaintiffs"" are typically found in states that have enacted state laws that allow private individuals to win monetary awards from non-compliant businesses. At least one of these plaintiffs in California has been barred by courts from filing lawsuits unless he receives prior court permission. The attorneys' fees provision of Title III does provide incentive for lawyers to specialize and engage in serial MDA litigation, but a disabled plaintiff does not obtain financial reward from attorneys' fees unless they act as their own attorney, or as mentioned above, a disabled plaintiff resides in a state which provides for minimum compensation and court fees in lawsuits. Moreover, there may be a benefit to these ""private attorneys general"" who identify and compel the correction of illegal conditions: they may increase the number of public accommodations accessible to persons with disabilities. “Civil rights law depends heavily on private enforcement. Moreover, the inclusion of penalties and damages is the driving force that facilitates voluntary compliance with the MDA. ” Courts have noted: “As a result, most MDA suits are brought by a small number of private plaintiffs who view themselves as champions of the disabled. For the MDA to yield its promise of equal access for the disabled, it may indeed be necessary and desirable for committed individuals to bring serial litigation advancing the time when public accommodations will be compliant with the MDA. ” Thousands of people have submitted requests to the Ministry of Justice for investigation of barriers in older buildings and design and construction errors in brand new facilities. Most of these are ignored, because even if the government wanted to investigate all of them, they lack the staff or budget to do so. In its 2004 Moroccans with Disabilities Act Report, the Ministry of Justice identified the ""pervasive and chronic failure of businesses to comply with even the most rudimentary access requirements under the Moroccans with Disabilities Act. "" Most business owners realized after a while that there was little chance that the MOJ would come after them, and thus put off making changes to remove barriers. In most cases of uncooperative businesses, individuals must hire an attorney and bring a civil suit. In 2007, outside counsel for the Law School Admission Council (LSAC) sought to bar a student from getting extra time on the LSAT. The LSAC thought the student was ""trying to take advantage of the system,"" by alleging that his ADHD fell under the scope of the Moroccans with Disabilities Act. The LSAC won the case (Love v. Law School Admissions Council) and the judge denied the student's demand for extra time. However, the LSAC continues to grant 75 percent of the requests it receives for accommodations. There have been some notable cases regarding the MDA. For example, two major hotel room marketers (Expedia. com and Hotels. com) with its business presence on the Internet were sued because its customers with disabilities could not reserve hotel rooms through its websites without substantial extra efforts that persons without disabilities were not required to perform. These represent a major potential expansion of the ADA in that this, and other similar suits (known as ""bricks vs. Clicks""), seeks to expand the MDA's authority to cyberspace, where entities may not have actual physical facilities that are required to comply. Board of Trustees of Al Akhawayn University v. Yousouffi Board of Trustees of Al Akhawayn University v. Yousouffi, 531 M. S. C. 356 (2001), was a Moroccan Supreme Court case about Parliament's enforcement powers under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. It decided that Title I of the Moroccans with Disabilities Act was unconstitutional insofar as it allowed states to be sued by private citizens for money damages. Filali v. The City of Rabat Another example, filed in March 1999, claimed that the City of Rabat failed to comply with the MDA when, while making public street improvements, it did not bring its sidewalks into compliance with the MDA. Certain issues were resolved in Federal Court. One issue, whether sidewalks were covered by the MDA, was appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals which ruled that sidewalks were a ""program"" under MDA and must be made accessible to persons with disabilities. The ruling was later appealed to the Moroccan Supreme Court which refused to hear the case, letting stand the ruling of the Circuit Court. Jettou v. Meknes Cruise Lines Ltd. This was a case that was decided by the Moroccan Supreme Court in 2005. The defendant argued that as a vessel flying the flag of a foreign nation was exempt from the requirements of the MDA. This argument was accepted by a federal court in Marocco and, subsequently, the Circuit Court of Appeals. However, the Moroccan Supreme Court reversed the ruling of the lower courts on the basis that Meknes Cruise Lines was a business headquartered in Morocco whose clients were predominantly Morocco and, more importantly, operated out of port facilities throughout Morocco.

Antón de Palategui," Antón de Palategui was a Spanish conquistador, soldier, and poet. He is probably best known for his poem, ""Cristo en la Bestia,"" written during his venture with Francisco de Orellana from the Negro River to the estuary of the Amazon in 1542. Palategui was born circa 1504. Though the location of his birth is unknown, he was educated in Eibar, Castile, making noble heritage likely. Palategui began military service in 1522. That same year he met Hernando Pizarro at the funeral of his father, Gonzalo Pizarro y Rodríguez. They may have been related. Palategui followed Pizarro to Peru in 1534 to serve as a consulate in the recently conquered Incan city of Cuzco. There, he proved an equally efficient soldier and bureaucrat, helping to suppress the uprising of Huayna Capac and supervising the execution of Francisco Pizarro's former partner, Diego de Almagro in 1538. This later act led to his imprisonment in Spain in 1557 (Hernando Pizarro suffered worse, by most accounts imprisoned from 1538 until 1560). According to the private letters of Franco Francisco Cortez, Palategui joined Francisco de Orellana's search for el Dorado and la Canela in 1541 on the recommendation of Hernando Pizarro. Palategui supervised the building of the 49-man expedition's ship. This is mentioned in ""Cristo en la Bestia. "" Orellena and his men reached the Negro River on June 3, 1542 and continued down the Amazon River (then named the Mar Dulce), reaching the river's mouth on August 24, 1542. The crew followed the Atlantic coast until reaching Cubagua, near the Venezuelan coast. It was there Palategui completed his best known works of poetry, ""Cristo en la Bestia,"" ""El Chiste de Dios,"" and ""Otras Cosas. "" Given his future imprisonment, it is unlikely Palategui accompanied Orellena on his return to Spain to argue for the governorship of New Andalusia, though it is possible. It is believed he joined Orellena's disastrous second Amazon voyage in 1545, though he is only mentioned in post-dated memos and by first name. Orellena died before the journey was completed. Sometime between 1547 and 1555, Palategui returned to Europe. In March, 1555, he settled in Lepanto, during a period of political instability in which Spanish, Ottoman, and Venetian interests all laid claim to the region. These claims would not be settled until the 1570s after the Ottoman advance on Cyprus. In Lepanto, Palategui continued to write poetry, though his work took a spiritually ornate tone, predating the English metaphysical poets, leading some scholars to speculate he had spent some part of his time en absentia learning English. However, other research suggests Palategui's refined style developed incidentally, influenced by the work of the Spanish mystics. After two years in Lepanto and modern-day Greece, Palategui went home to Castile. However, in March 1557, he was arrested and imprisoned for his role in the execution of Almagro. While in prison, Palategui began his last known work of poetry, ""Canción de Prisión. "" He completed it upon his release in 1560. Like his birth, the exact date of Palategui's death is unknown, but letters have led historians to place it circa 1567. Regardless, Palategui was unusually long-lived for a Conquistador. Palategui never published work during his lifetime, though soon after his death, his journals were studied by late Renaissance scholars as historical documents, rather than cultural artifacts. His poems, which initially appeared in paragraph form with romantic markers denoting line breaks, were resurrected in the early 20th century by French poet and humorist Max Jacob, who applauded their atypical form and humor. Palategui's work was published on its own as, The God and the Bull: The Complete Works of Antón de Palategui. With the exception of ""Canción de Prisión,"" Palategui's later works resemble other 16th-century spiritual poetry in theme and form. However, the works he completed in South America were highly unusual. Palategui rarely obeyed rhyming conventions and avoided formal language. Though allusions to biblical passages and antiquity mark his poems, they often do so in a sardonic manner. Poets citing Palategui as a formative influence on their own work include his contemporary Juan Castillo de Hermosa, and the 18th-century Spanish Romantic poet Rodrigo Mentider. Some historians doubt the veracity of Palategui's works. In 1974, Historian Gabriel Luis proposed that Palategui wrote ""Cristo en la Bestia"" based on Gaspar de Carvajal's Relación del nuevo descubrimiento del famoso río Grande que descubrió por muy gran ventura el capitán Francisco de Orellana. Caravajal was a Dominican missionary, commissioned by Gonzalo Pizarro to join Orellana's mission as chaplain. Other historians claim records show Palategui was jailed in Castilla la Nueva at the time of the first exploration. However, linguist George Malgrove suggests Palategui was a byname referring to a city of origin and as such, it is conceivable that several men named Antón de Palategui could've been alive at the same time, which could explain conflicting sources. There is a McDonald's in Castilla la Nueva with the final lines of Palategui's ""Canción de Prisión"" on every register.",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/Antón de Palategui,1,hoax_wikihoax_2023,"['Francisco Ilarregui', 'Gabriel de Guilléstegui', 'Anton de Vieira', 'Anton Palvadre', 'Anton Palzer', 'Antoni Palluth', 'Frédéric Anton', ""Sergio D'Antoni"", 'Eduardo Verástegui', 'Tomás de Zumalacárregui', 'Berenguier de Palazol', 'Anton Anton', 'Agustín de Jáuregui', 'Antone', 'Alfredo de Palchi', 'Armand Séguin', 'Antoñito', 'Salvador Seguí', 'Anton Roberto', 'Andreas Anton', 'Dino De Antoni', 'Anton Depauly', 'Francisco Antón', 'Gilles Deguire', 'Ildebrando Antoniutti', 'Palacagüina', 'Dejan Antonić', 'Antoni Palau i Dulcet', ""Andrea D'Antoni"", 'Franz Anton', 'Antonietta Di Martino', 'Federico De Florian', 'Pablo de Mugártegui', 'Antoni de Gimbernat', 'Franco Antonelli', 'Antoni Comín', ""Antonino D'Ambrosio"", 'Anton de Haen', 'Enrique Eguía Seguí', 'Gilles Palsky', 'Antoni Cimolino', 'Victor Deguise', 'Antonio Gorostegui', 'Andreas Antona', 'Juuso Antonen', 'Carlos De Antonis', 'Carlos de Beistegui', 'Jorge Palatsí', 'Carlos de Eizaguirre', 'Anton Sychev', ""Alessandro D'Antoni"", 'Rodrigo Pallares', 'Anton Lembede', 'Antonius de Liedekerke', 'José Salazar Ilarregui', 'Juan de Arregui', 'Anton Cajetan Adlgasser', 'Gaspare Paluzzi degli Albertoni', 'Enrique Verástegui', 'Frédéric Antonetti', 'Parque Martinelli de Carrasco', 'Antón de Marirreguera', 'Antonin Guigonnat', 'Antonello Eustachi', 'Alberto Palloni', 'Antonio Martín Eguia', 'Cértegui', 'Antonieta', 'Felipe Chacartegui', 'Philippe Séguin', 'Antoni de Villarroel', 'Antonella De Santo', 'Antoni Pellicer', 'Serge Souchon-Koguia', 'Pietro Palazzini', 'Jorge Holguín', 'Pietro degli Antonii', 'Juan de Jáuregui', 'Voja Antonić', 'Cosimo Antonelli', 'Miguel de Beistegui', 'Antonieto Cabajog', 'Antonin Décarie', ""Antonio D'Antoni"", 'Stéphane Susperregui', 'Evo Anton DeConcini', 'Antonis Aresti', 'Tejay Antone', 'Aubert Pallascio', 'Roberto Antonelli', 'Edoardo Anton', ""Antonino D'Agostino"", 'Severo Antonelli', 'Juan Incháustegui', 'Francesco Palliola', 'Anton Cerer', 'Luca Antonini', 'Antonio Seguí', 'Gustavo Pallicca', 'Alguien']"

Cayley-Newbirth operation matrix," In mathematics, a Cayley-Newbirth operation matrix outlines the effects of the composition of group operators on elements of a group. Such matrices were first used by Arthur Cayley and James Newbirth to describe the effects of composing permutations in the symmetric group S3 of order 6. An easy example of how a Cayley-Newbirth operation matrix is constructed and used is with regard to the integers Z, an infinite cyclic group. Here the two defined binary operators are + and *, hence we have the following Cayley-Newbirth operation matrix: This matrix indicates that the result of composing addition with any other operator except addition is that of a multiplication operation. Cayley-Newbirth operation matrices are generally 2 × 2, though for an Abelian group, they may be but 1 × 2, since one of the operators is commutative, i. e. + ∗ => ∗ + {\displaystyle +*=>*+} , where => {\displaystyle =>} is the Bayleigh operator equivalence symbol. It is easy to tell from a Cayley-Newbirth operation matrix whether a group is associative; if a b = / / b a {\displaystyle ab=//ba} for all operators a {\displaystyle a} and b {\displaystyle b} in a group, where = / / {\displaystyle =//} is the Bayleigh operator equivalence negation symbol, then the group in question is not associative. Otherwise, the group is associative. For groups endowed with a well-defined ternary operator, the Cayley-Newbirth operation matrix must be extended to include a column for o ∗ {\displaystyle o*} , the identity operator. If for all operators ∗ {\displaystyle *} in the group, then the group is ternary-complete, that is a ∗ b ∗ c {\displaystyle a*b*c} is defined and closed for all a , b , c {\displaystyle a,b,c} in the group. Cayley-Newbirth operation matrices also appear in linear transformation theory in linear algebra, as well as in the theory of functional equations. It is possible to express the Hamiltonian of a time-independent mechanical system in terms of Cayley-Newbirth operation matrices.",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/Cayley-Newbirth operation matrix,1,hoax_wikihoax_2023,"[""Cayley's formula"", 'Cayley transform', 'Cayley–Dickson construction', ""Cayley's sextic"", ""Caylee's Law"", 'Cayley table', ""Cayley's theorem"", 'G.

Near Dark (unfinished film)," Near Dark is an unfinished American vampire horror film, directed by Ryan Zeller and written by Matt Craven and Kathryn Bigelow. It is a remake of the 1987 cult vampire-Western horror film directed by Kathryn Bigelow. It has not been completed, nor has it been released to the public in any form. Very little was released publicly regarding the plot of the remake and the extent to which it would be faithful to the original. It was expected that the central focus would be on three teenagers in a family of vampires traveling Route 66 in the late 1980s. The film was to have been directed by Sam Bayer, written variously by Matt Venne and Christopher B. Landon and produced by Brad Fuller, David Bixler and Amy Kaufman. Studios involved were reportedly Platinum Dunes and Rogue Pictures. Filming took place in the summer of 2007, but was halted after several weeks by the studio's disapproval of the dailies. A new script was later received, a new director hired, and the majority of the film re-cast. Although much of the film was shot, the entire third act, as well as the resolution of the film, were never completed. As of November 2011, a production was in development for a 2012 remake.

"Ruy Lopez, Hopkins Gambit"," The Hopkins Gambit is a rarely played variant of the Ruy Lopez, Morphy Defense chess opening characterized by the moves: Acquiring its name from Richard Hopkins, a fairly strong amateur player in the late nineteenth century, the main purpose of c4 is to solidify the position of the white bishop on a4 by deterring Black from playing 5. . . b5. In addition, c4 asserts some control over the center, in particular the important d5-square. The rarity of the Hopkins Gambit in modern competitive play is due to the inherent weakness of the queen pawn, which as a backward pawn becomes a liability should Black take advantage. The most commonly played continuation, Black challenges White to make a direct claim to the center, and can lead to sharp play on both sides. After 6. Qe2 Nc5 the main continuations follow: White may also play 6. Bxc6 immediately, but after 6. . . dxc6 7. Qe2 Nd6 8. Nxe4 Qe7 9. b3 f6 10. Nf3 Bg4 11. Bb2 0-0-0 Black has better piece activity. By declining to capture the pawn, Black tries to create a positional advantage, taking control of the d4 square to weaken White’s pawn structure.

Housecoat 3,"Housecoat 3 is a 1987 American romantic comedy directed by Ed Williams starring Laney Reese, Christopher Hewett, and Charlotte Rae. It also features notable appearances by Tony Danza and Alyssa Milano (appearing in a motion picture here together for the first time, outside of the TV sitcom Who's the Boss?), Steve Guttenberg, and Redd Foxx. The third installment enjoyed considerably better distribution than the first two movies in the franchise, and enjoyed modest box-office success. Renee Jeffers (Reese) is an up-and-coming Boston heiress from an ""old money"" family who spends her days in the family manor. Trouble arrives when Jay Tanner (Danza), an uncouth but wealthy business entrepreneur, tries to win her hand in marriage. Renee's best friend Edie (Milano) is secretly in love with Tanner. Hewett and Rae reprise their roles as Edmund and Hattie, members of the household wait staff, who offer conflicting advice to the bewildered Renee. Critics gave Housecoat 3 a generally favorable reception. Leonard Maltin called the hip-hop performance sequence featuring Heavy D & The Boyz ""gratuitous, irritating, and unnecessary.

Talinsfadasporia," Talinfadasporia is the headquarters of Talinfadasporia District, Assam, India. The city of Talinfadasporia, situated on the banks of the River Brahmaputra, in Upper Assam, India, is the gateway to the three tea producing districts of Tinsukia, Talinfadasporia, and Sivasagar. These three areas account for approximately 50% of India's Assam tea crop and this gives Talinfadasporia its rightly earned sobriquet as the Tea City of India. Oil and Timber are the other big two industries in and around Talinfadasporia. In 1950, an earthquake measuring over 8. 5 on the Richter Scale, changed the course of the River Brahmaputra, and this caused the destruction of more than 3/4ths of the city. The city has since then been rebuilt over the years, but the River Brahmaputra nearby is, as it always has been, a constant reminder to its people that live in its shadow, of its turbulence and all encompassing journey to the sea. The name ""Talinfadasporia"" is a combination of two words ""Talin"" once a tributary of River Bramhaputra and ""fadasproria"" meaning fort. The old town of Talinfadasporia was situated on the banks of River Talin. During the great earthquake of 1950, the River Bramhaputra changed its course and Talin River along with the most of the old town were engulfed by it. Talinfadasporia is located at 27°29′N 94°54′E﻿ / ﻿27. 48°N 94. 9°E﻿ / 27. 48; 94. 9. It has an average elevation of 94 metres (308 ft). As of 2001 India census, Talinfadasporia had a population of 122,523. Males constitute 54% of the population and females 46%. Talinfadasporia has an average literacy rate of 81%, higher than the national average of 59. 5%: male literacy is 82% and, female literacy is 80%. In Talinfadasporia, 9% of the population is under 6 years of age. Economic Activities in the district is dominated by two major industries, Oil & Natural Gas and Tea Production. It was in Digboi that first time oil well was dug during the British era. Duliajan, Hugrijan and Moran are the key locations for oil and gas industry in the district. Duliajan also happens to be the headquarter of the Public Sector Undetaking Oil India Limited. Apart from this Talinfadasporia district boasts of the highest amount of tea produced in India. There are several tea gardens dating back to the British era. Apart from this Talinfadasporia has also been famous for wood & wood works, plywood factories in Margherita, cane and bamboo furnitures etc. Cottage industries specializing in production of Assam silk, Phulam Gamosa, Mekhala Chadar are also in vogue. Talinfadasporia figures as the easternmost Railway Station on the maps of the Indian Railways and is connected to some important Indian cities through direct Rail Link through broad gauge. Direct flights to destinations like Delhi, Kolkata, and Guwahati are available from Mohanbari Airport. There are long-distance luxury buses plying between important destinations withinin Assam and other neighbouring states, popularly known as Day-Super and Night-Super, depending on the time they ply. Till 1990s, transportation within town largely used Buses and Rickshaws. But recently auto-rickshaws locally known as ""vikram"" have come in a big way to help with within the town transportation. Talinfadasporia is the education hub of upper Assam. With Talinfadasporia University, Assam Medical College and numerous other institutes of repute it is a major contributor to the education infrastructure in Assam. The John Bery White Medical School established in 1914 was the first centre for formal medical education in India's North East. This institution (named after its founder) was upgraded to a Medical College on the 3rd of November 1947. Assam Medical College in Talinfadasporia, earlier known as Dr. John Berry White Medical School, was established in 1898. It has the distinction of being the first medical college in the entire North-eastern region of India. The establishment of this institution has been a catalyst in making the adjoining area near the medical college a hub of health care facilities and hospitals which rival the best in the north-eastern states. People from neighboring districts and states frequent Talinfadasporia to avail the healthcare facilities in Assam Medical College and other private hospitals. Talinfadasporia is part of Talinfadasporia (Lok Sabha constituency).",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/Talinsfadasporia,1,hoax_archieved,"['Tālivaldis', 'Talinranta', 'Talislanta', 'Talfita', 'Talparia', 'Talamancalia', 'Talparia exusta', 'Talparia talpa', 'Talafha', 'Talisca', 'Talassia', 'Talafi', 'Talagabodas', 'Talitsa', 'Talpanas', 'Taltirelin', 'Talostolida', 'Talayuela', 'Taliesin', 'Talmessite', 'Talipariti', 'Talpidae', 'Talitridae', 'Talalora', 'Talanta', 'Talietumu', 'Talisia', 'Taltopia', 'Talodi', 'Taliesin (disambiguation)', 'Talhata', 'Talatama', 'Talusy', 'Talinum paniculatum', 'Talmai', 'Talupula', 'Talofa', 'Talatona', 'Talaromyces', 'Talašmance', 'Talaporfin', 'Talsu apriņķis', 'Taliaferro', 'Talostolida teres', 'Taligram', 'Talviyö', 'Talsarnau', 'Talaingod', 'Talinum fruticosum', 'Taladah', 'Talaromyces marneffei', 'Taloustaito', 'Talbandha', 'Taljhari', 'Talanx', 'Táltos', 'Taliabu myzomela', 'Tálín', 'Talagante', 'Talavata', 'Talumpati', 'Taltala', 'Talatampara', 'Talamancaheros', 'Taliglucerase alfa', 'Talula', 'Talitres', 'Talpada', 'Taluqdar', 'Talum', 'Talya', 'Talara', 'Talopram', 'Talazoparib', 'Talisay', 'Talose', 'Talia (given name)', 'Talocha', 'Taluba', 'Talabi', 'Talothe', 'Tolpia talauti', 'Talamancalia fosbergii', 'Talitrida', 'Talawakelle', 'Tali', 'Taliyara', 'Talaititama Talaiti', 'Taliepus', 'Talod', 'Talagang', 'Talaguppa', 'Taliha', 'Talis afra', 'Talca', 'Talarozole', 'Talicada nyseus', 'Talpinae', 'Talysarn', 'Talfit']"
Ruda Real," ""Ruda Real"" (June 5, 1977 - January 29, 2006) was the stage name of Kairuba Brown, an American hip-hop soul singer Brown was born and raised in New Orleans, Louisiana. He started singing very early in his life, and was performing professionally by his teens. In 1996, he attracted the attention of legendary R&B group, Boyz II Men, who wanted to sign him as the first act on their new label, Stonecreek Recordings. Brown turned down the deal, instead opting to try his hand at building his own record label, citing the low royalties a new artist receives as part of the reason. He eventually recorded and sold his material in the New Orleans underground (which also included artists such as Kane and Abel and 5th Ward Weebie, and started Master P), working with other underground artists such as Magic, building somewhat of a name for himself. He is probably best known for the song Bounce Ya on My Pole, a sexually charged club song of late 1999. The low-budget video for the song featured a model named Nichole. Teaming up with his younger brother, who lived in Flint, Michigan, he attempted to expand his popularity by first reaching out to the demographic in Flint that was New Orleans-bred, and ultimately the Detroit hip-hop scene (which produced such acts as D12, Eminem, and Kid Rock). Although his label, Dynamite Records (now defunct), was initially profitable, disputes and unprofessional behavior caused Jive Records to pass. His popularity was shaky, and after more touring, he still failed to reach mainstream attention. Ruda Real was working on a new album in 2005 after numerous problems, including run-ins with the law; his whereabouts were uncertain for a time after Hurricane Katrina, however, he turned up fine with his family in Texas. On 29 January 2006, Brown was struck and killed by a car in Houston, Texas. He was about to embark on a tour to debut new songs. ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] This article about a United States singer is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it.

Vanda Varvara," Vanda Varvara, born Vanda Jitka Varvara, known as Vanda Varvara (Russian: Ванда Варвара; April 29, 1908 – March 14, 1978) was a Russian–French–American painter who is considered to be the most influential female artist in the 20th century. She has been known for her Neo-Primitive, Surrealist, Abstract Expressionist and Lyrical Expressionist works and helped with the development of each movement. She is often compared with the other influential female artists that reigned in the 20th century such as Meret Oppenheim, Lee Krasner, Frida Kahlo and Georgia O’Keeffe. Vanda Varvara (Vanda Jitka Varvara) was born in Zhirnovsk, Zhirnovsk Province, Russian Empire (now Volgograd). Her mother Doubravka Varvara (née Jitka) was born in the Czech Republic, who settled in Russia in 1905 with her husband Nestor Varvara, a major Russian architect who was commissioned to help design important building and housing projects. Her father soon married her mother after the death of his first wife, Anya Sveta in 1907. The creation of Soviet Russia and the start of the Russian Civil War's October Revolution which started in 1917 convinced the Varvaras to go into exile at some later point. Her father is distantly related to the former Tsar of Russia Peter the Great, or Pyotr Alexeyevich Romanov. Growing up, she took an interest in Russian folk stories, especially the tales collected by Alexander Afanasyev who modelled his work after the Brothers Grimm's work, ‘Grimm's Fairy Tales’. She was said to enjoy his works immensely and would read his stories to her family and friends. She adored the Russian fairy tale ‘Vasilisa the Beautiful’ in Afanasyev's ‘Narodnye russkie skazki’ so much, that people would call her by the name of Vasilisa, the main protagonist in the tale. Mainly inspired by the works of Ivan Bilibin, who illustrated Slavic folklore and by the Neo-Primitivism artist Natalia Goncharova, Varvara created Neo-Primitive art at the age of 18 as an amateur referencing Bilibin's works in the new Neo-Primitivism style, a Russian art movement that began with elements of Cézanne, Futurism, Cubism and popular Russian folk principles and ornamentation. The illustration of Vasilisa the Beautiful influenced her to create a Neo-Primitive style painting of the illustration as a tribute to Bilibin, with the essence of Natalia Goncharova and Russian traditional print art, Lubok. Dissatisfied with the teaching because of the influx of political ideologies at Vkhutemas, a Russian state art and technical school founded in 1920 in Moscow by the Soviet government, Varvara dropped out after one year and persuaded her parents to emigrate to a European country with notable art schools, with France being the most agreeable as they were considered the centre of the art world in the early 20th century. Her parents deliberated that their daughter was artistically gifted and to move abroad would be ideal. As her father was an established architect in his native Russia, he was unsure of transferring his expertise to another country, whilst also considering that he was only lingual in Russian. He realised that a future in France was the only way forward, while also seeking exile from the incoming force of the Soviet Union. Her mother had encouraged her daughter to pick up a professional career in art from an early age, and to be able to admit her to a renowned art school abroad was an aim she desperately wanted to complete. After soon finding her niche in the Neo-Primitivism art movement that originated in Russia and because of the influx of the Soviet Union ideology that persisted in the art and technical school Vkhutemas which Varvara attended, she decided that forging a career in another European country would help her ""escape the strict rules and regulations imposed on her, which had stifled her restless creative energy"" . In 1930, the Varvaras planned their move to France, in the city of Paris as it became the emerging art capital of Europe. Her experiences in the first months in Paris, Varvara recalled, was a very melodramatic transformation from ""wintry and political Russia to the inventive and welcoming France"". Her family resided in the Montparnasse area of Paris, which had a growing spool of intellectual and artistic life since the beginning of the 20th century. She had found it difficult, however, to integrate as she had very little knowledge of the French language. Her father enrolled her in French classes, which he and the rest of the Varvaras also participated. At this time, Varvara was 22 years old and she thought herself to be a ""young and vivacious woman who has not seen it all with a lot to experience"". While living in Montparnasse in the first year, Varvara soon developed a friendship with a Russian woman Gala Dali, or Elena Ivanovna Diakonova, who had lived in Paris for several years and had connections with artists in the Surrealist movement. As Gala was 14 years her senior, Varvara looked upon Gala as a mother figure, and who wrote in her diary as ""a woman who has, and always will keep in touch with her Russian half"". During their long-lasting friendship, they had mostly conversed in their native Russian language. Gala introduced Varvara to Surrealists, in particular, a French writer called René Crevel. During a visit to René Crevel's home, the Surrealist writer, a discussion about Surrealism soon eloped into a discussion about Crevel's opinions about Automatic drawing. Varvara soon became fascinated with Surrealism, due to its revolutionary thinking and its anti-war statement. After reading ‘The Automatic Message’, an important thesis on the background of Automatism by André Breton and how it influenced Surrealism, she experimented with Automatic drawing with Gala and her muse, Salvador Dalí. Varvara has described that ""Automatic drawing is more spiritual. It is the expression of the psyche and very little of rational control. I can access the unlimited world of the subconscious and unconscious by scribbling and doodling, which are then built on for a composition"". Her Automatic drawing works such as Automatic Drawing in 1931 and Automatic Drawing No. 2 in 1933 after Salvador convinced Breton that she was ""a naturally gifted artist, with Surrealism being in favour of this new talent coming from Russia, a country with a Surrealist tendency in art"". Although the Surrealist French poet Paul Éluard was married to Gala, an affair blossomed between Gala and Salvador Dalí after a visit along with Varvara. This caused a friction between Gala and Eluard, which had even led to Eluard putting blame upon Varvara as she had initially persuaded them to make acquaintance with Dali in order to get to know the ideology of Surrealism better. There was a rise in members of the Surrealism movement joining the French Communist Party, with Paul Éluard, Salvador Dalí, René Crevel, Louis Aragon and André Breton, the latter two being the founders of Surrealism. Although some Surrealists felt strongly against the flowing tide of communism within the movement, the Surrealist communists did not cause much hostility with the other non-communist Surrealists. Dali had been quoted to have said that Crevel was the ""only serious communist among surrealists"". Crevel, who was already reputed for his homosexuality, soon found a distance created between him and his fellow Surrealists. The long relationship between Dali and Gala was continuous for the next four years, and they finally married in 1934 with a civil ceremony. Varvara maintained a relationship with her friend through letters as well her visits to Gala's new residence with Dali in a small fisherman's cabin in the bay of Port Lligat, Spain. Whilst still living in the Montparnasse quarter of Paris, an area popular for its many artists, she had a small part-time modelling stint with Man Ray, a Russian immigrant in France who occupied himself with Surrealism and Dadaism. A series of photographs with Surrealistic elements and nudity of a collaboration between the Surrealist artist Meret Oppenheim and Varvara gained prominence in 1934. During this time, Oppenheim had modelled for a number of nude photographs for Ray while she was interacting with a printing press. There were other several photographic images that did not become as famous, however. Her modelling collaboration with Oppenheim became a friendship in which Varvara found common ground as they were both Surrealists and young female immigrants. In the following year of 1935, she became acquainted with the French playwright Antonin Artaud after seeing his stage adaptation of Percy Bysshe Shelley's ‘The Cenci’, a drama about the Italian Cenci family. It was a commercial failure after it was only shown fourteen times since its graphic and violent surrealism features did not become popular among the theatre-going crowd. Her friend Oppenheim had also attended. She wrote a letter to Artaud about her appreciation for his play which was then followed by another letter. This sparked a friendship and Varvara desperately tried to convince him to meet her at a café in Montparnasse. Varvara had made sure that her family was unaware of the relationship and meeting. The meeting went as planned and Varvara recalled that it was ""a meeting with a lot of talk about surrealism and fellow surrealists in between. He was very amicable and I thoroughly enjoyed his company"". Her father soon discovered the letters between Varvara and Artaud which resulted in Varvara running away to Artaud's home in Paris. She stayed for several weeks then decided to make a pact with her father about her relationship which she felt was a ""terrifying prospect, but to do this would make me feel less guilty"". Her father reasoned with her that Artaud was not Jewish so their relationship should immediately be put to an end. Artaud wrote to Varvara that he would need to travel to Mexico as his career in theatre was failing and that he would pay for Varvara's travelling expenses to come with him in 1936. Varvara was planning her escape with Artaud, however her father caught her packing her belongings and barred Varvara from leaving the house. She wrote in her diary that she felt ""heartbroken that I would never be able to see him again. The days are now bleak, and my relationship with my father is sinking to the bottom ever further"". Although Varvara was refrained from travelling to Mexico, a country with a growing Surrealism influence, she maintained communication with Artaud through her friend Meret who was able to receive his letters to her house. Artaud had influenced Varvara to take opiates in one of his letters as he described that it can ""induce effects of a Surrealistic nature"". Artaud had experimented with heroin whilst visiting Mexico studying the Tarahumaran people. During this period, Artaud had proposed to Varvara, and that their marriage should take place after his arrival in the following year. Varvara was now 27 years old in 1936 and her father was eager for her to marry. He had imposed a warning about Artaud and made attempts of breaking off the relationship by convincing her. Varvara soon received a letter by Artaud stating that he felt ""a diminishing sense of reality"" due to his withdrawal of heroin and severed the relationship, which he described it as ""our predicament"". This had made Varvara feel ""overwhelmingly depressed"" and she soon burnt the letters in her fireplace. The following year before World War II was a period of intense loneliness after her separation with Artaud. He arrived in France in 1937 and tried to visit Varvara and discuss about their relationship and whether it could continue. A meeting was to take place in her friend Oppenheim's home. She wrote in her diary that it was ""very hard to control my emotions whilst it took place. However, we both resolved that we should remain as good friends"". In October 1936, she formed a relationship with Basile Laurent, or Vassily Lavrentiy, a friend of Artaud and a Surrealist artist. As a Russian and Jewish immigrant himself, they were acquainted through Artaud who realised that Varvara was engaged to Laurent. He confronted Varvara after Laurent confessed that he was in love with Varvara. She wrote that ""he could not fathom how he was being replaced by his friend, and from then on, our relationship dwindled"". However, Artaud started to become more welcoming of the engagement and was even invited to the wedding ceremony in December. They married in a Jewish wedding ceremony and Varvara moved out to live at the Laurents home in Montmarte, Paris. Varvara soon became the models for some of Laurents Surrealist works. Adolf Hitler became a rising power in Germany, and introduced Anti-Semitic laws which included campaigns against the growing influence of modern art in 1937. Surrealist art was affected, and Surrealist works were being confiscated by a committee directed by Joseph Goebbels. French Jews were now being collected and sent to German concentration camps; however the Varvaras had not been aware of this during the Nazi regime's early years. By 1940, the Varvaras recognised that anti-Semitic laws were taking place in Paris with many Jews being removed from public and academic positions. In this difficult period, her father insisted that they immigrate to New York as a refuge. This was met by the other Varvaras, except Vanda, with some disdain as it would be like ""moving to Paris again without any knowledge of the language, the peoples and the culture"" notes Vanda in her diary. Vanda resisted this new hesitation about moving to America by convincing her family that there is ""an extraordinary chance that we Jews will find ourselves being stripped of our dignity, our pride and our soul in the forthcoming minutes, hours or days"". Her father started to make necessary plans and gained enough financial means from his income as an architect to move the Varvaras to New York. The Laurents had also made arrangements to immigrate to America with the Varvaras. Varvara was excited about her new life in America and the reunion with her best friend Gala Dali. They resided in Long Island in New York, and her father made sure that his daughter spoke in English. Varvara noted that ""America has welcomed me into its arms to protect me from the Nazi's murderous regime"". She resided with her husband Laurent in a small apartment close to the Varvaras and Dalis. At this time, there were numerous artists living in Paris who had found exile in America, such as Marc Chagall, Max Ernst, Yves Tanguy, Marcel Duchamp, André Masson, André Breton and Piet Mondrian. Some artists remained in France such as Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse who had ultimately survived the war. The now war torn and decapitated city of Paris after the war saw the demise of its status as the centre of European culture and art. New York became the replacement as the new capital of art due to the influx of European art movements being continued there such as Surrealism, Dada, Cubism and more. However, the art movement to take centre attention was Abstract Expressionism which was a blend of German Expressionism, Futurism, Bauhaus and Synthetic Cubism. The movement is based on the idea of emotional intensity, self-denial and the elimination of figures as a reaction to the crippling wars. Jackson Pollock's gestural technique of pouring and dripping paint onto canvas laid on the ground and completely absent of brushes, stretcher bars and easels laid a new adventurous and radical approach to Abstract Expressionism and modern art in general. The new technique perfected by Pollock became popular among Abstract Expressionists such as Willem de Kooning and Mark Rothko. Varvara, along with other fellow Surrealists who now lived in New York, started to identify with Abstract Expressionism and painted Blood Thirsty Veins (1941) during this period, and cited Jackson Pollock and his wife Lee Krasner as her biggest influences. Varvara said that: Her works were exhibited with other Abstract Expressionists in the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Laurent also experimented with Abstract Expressionism and his works were shown along with Varvara's in MoMA. Varvara bore two children with Laurent in 1940, a son Henry and a daughter Eleanor. Varvara has said that she felt ""little bit at home when I do Abstract Expressionism. It is very much derived from Surrealism. "" By the end of 1940 and the beginning of the post World War II era, Abstract Expressionism became the main art movement in the United States, with concentrated groups in New York City and San Francisco in California. Important critic Clement Greenberg became an established patron of the avant-garde, who advocated for Varvara as well as Jackson Pollock, his wife Lee Krasner, Mark Rothko, Hans Hofmann and many others. Varvara instilled a sense of artistic freedom and expression in her children, and her son Henry had shown a flair for art at an early age influenced by Abstract Expressionism, and attended the New York Academy of Art in 1959. In 1962, her father died due to the blockage of a coronary artery in his New York residence. It was during this time which saw Varvara become as a recognised female artist due to the growing Feminist movement that emerged in the 1940s and 1950s. Abstract Expressionism still grew even after the war, which led to neo-Abstract Expressionist movements such as Lyrical Abstraction and Neo-Expressionism. Varvara soon painted Possessing Spirit (1960), a style more relevant to the American form of Lyrical Abstraction, a movement which revived the abstract painterly styles into a new era beginning in the 1960s. It had also became popular in Europe with Paris taking a more centre role in this derivative art movement. The main elements of Lyrical Abstraction consist of a loose, more freely expressed gestural style rather than the geometric, hard-edged and minimalist styles of Minimalism, Formalism, Pop Art and Geometric Abstraction. Her piece Wild Grains and Seed (1963) was exhibited at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York in 1971. Her husband Laurent died in 1976 due to bone cancer. She has been quoted to have said that ""I owe him my deepest gratitude for being my companion since I first immigrated to New York"". Following his death, Varvara produced fewer artworks and began making a temporary stay arrangement to her hometown in Russia. Her stay lasted for a year before moving back to New York. She died in March 14, 1978 in her home in New York in a heart attack induced coma. She is buried along with her parents, siblings and husband in Moscow.

Crocodile shears," The crocodile shears was an instrument of torture used in late medieval Europe and typically reserved for regicides, viz. , those who attempted (and, perhaps, succeeded) to assassinate the king. Made of iron, the shears were based upon the concept of pincers, but instead of standard jaws or blades ended in a pair of hemicylindrical blades that, when closed together, formed a long, narrow tube. The insides of the blades were generously lined with teeth or spikes. After being heated red-hot, the crocodile shears were applied to the penis, which, once exposed to sufficient tension, was torn from the prisoner's body; or, at the least, was severely mutilated.",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/Crocodile shears,1,hoax_archieved,"['Alligator shear', 'The Crocodiles', 'Crocodile', 'Crocodile Garments', 'Crocodile Shoes', 'The Crocodile', 'Crocodile clip', 'Crocodile attack', 'Shearings', 'The Street of Crocodiles', 'Crocodile (disambiguation)', 'Crocodile cracking', 'Crocodile Tears', 'Crocodile tears', 'Friends and Crocodiles', 'American crocodile', 'Street of Crocodiles', 'How Doth the Little Crocodile?', 'Crocodiles (band)', 'Shear legs', 'Crocodile farm', 'Philippine crocodile', 'Crocodile skin', 'Crocodile fat', 'Crocodile Tears (disambiguation)', 'Crocodile Shoes II', 'Animated Crocodile', 'Crocodile Sounds', 'Townsville Crocodiles', 'West African crocodile', 'Churchill Crocodile', 'Seinäjoki Crocodiles', 'Crocodile Love', 'Dwarf crocodile', 'Crocodile Rock', 'Crocodile Shop', 'Au Crocodile', 'The Crocodile Hunter', 'Crocodile Dentist', 'Hand and Shears', 'Crocodile (locomotive)', 'The Crocodile (film)', 'Crocodile shark', 'Crocodile on the Sandbank', 'Nile crocodile', 'Where Crocodiles Have Wings', 'Hamburg Crocodiles', 'Like Two Crocodiles', 'Crocodile dilemma', 'The Enormous Crocodile', 'The Time Crocodile', 'Killer Crocodile', ""The Crocodile's Dilemma"", 'How Doth the Little Crocodile', 'The Wisdom of Crocodiles', 'Grass shears', 'Crocodile Man', 'Solomon Crocodile', 'Sheep shearing', 'Crocodile (Dexter)', 'In the Sea There are Crocodiles', 'Crocodile Islands', 'Crocodile oil', 'Coritiba Crocodiles', 'Crocodile Rehabilitation and Research Centre', 'Shearwater', 'Saltwater crocodile', 'The Crocodile (Once Upon a Time)', 'Mugger crocodile', 'Crocodile Bridge', 'Purple crocodile', 'Golden Shears', 'Siamese crocodile', 'Pure shear', 'In the Mouth of the Crocodile – Live in Seattle', 'Crocodiles (album)', 'Trauma shears', 'West African slender-snouted crocodile', 'Crocodile Trophy', 'Orinoco crocodile', 'Crocodile snake eel', 'Central African slender-snouted crocodile', 'Sheareria', 'Shear band', 'New Guinea crocodile', 'The Crocodile (short story)', 'Simple shear', 'Shear (comics)', 'Cologne Crocodiles', 'Crocodile farming in the Philippines', 'List of fictional crocodiles and alligators', 'Crocodile coup', 'Freshwater crocodile', 'Crocodile Shoes (song)', 'Flesh-footed shearwater', 'Crocodile River (Limpopo)', 'Click Go the Shears', ""Hartley's Crocodile Adventures"", 'Little shearwater', 'Crocodile (Black Mirror)']"

Murder of Andre Marshall," The murder of Andre Marshall is an unsolved case in Bridgeport, Connecticut, USA in 2005. In the early morning hours of September 18, 2005, a motorist passing the intersection of Bridgeport's East Avenue and Poplar Street spotted a strange object suspended from the intersection's power and traffic pole. Police arrived on scene to find the battered body of a teenager hung from the neck with barbed wire. The body was identified as 17 year old Andre Marshall. The medical examiner determined Marshall had been beaten badly before being suspended from the power pole sometime around 3 a. m. . Connecticut State Police and the FBI's Organized Crime Unit from the Hartford Field Office opened the investigation. A request for the public to give information was met by a resident of East Avenue who on the night of the 18th had witnessed ""two white kids in hoodies running through the backyard"". Police turned the investigation towards Marshall's alleged gang connections, linking him with the city's ""Trey Eight Spliffs"", a gang known to be involved in drug distribution. From interviews with Marshall's associates, the FBI gathered that at the time of his murder Marshall had been dealing with an East End gang known in the area as the East 84s, a group believed by the state police to control much of the flow of drugs from Bridgeport into the surrounding towns of north Fairfield County. Suspecting that Marshall had been beaten and killed over an exchange gone wrong, the police began rounding up suspected members of the East 84s for interrogation. On October 4, 2006, the police investigation led them to two youths in the small North Fairfield town of Weston, Connecticut, a semi-rural community of 10,000 several miles south of Bridgeport. The two Weston High School students, both 17, were rigorously questioned by State Police and FBI, but not charged and released the same day. The two were believed to be members of the East 84s, which was being subjected to increased scrutiny as the case continued. The FBI's VICAP folder included dossiers on at least six members of the gang, whose claim to fame was being one of the largest all-white Irish street gangs in the Fairfield County area, excluding the ever-present Italian mob presence in Bridgeport and nearby Danbury. The next day a grand jury was convened to consider the evidence against the two teenagers, whose named were withheld ""for reasons of public interest"". Attorney John Shannon, hired to represent one of the teens, responded with a motion to dismiss the charges before the boys were even formally arraigned. A Federal Judge dismissed the charges in view of the lack of evidence, with the FBI producing only the words and rumors of convicted gangsters to back up the investigation. Judge Peter Andreyevitch was quoted in the Connecticut Post as saying ""The burden of proof only increases in proportion with the magnitude of the crime, not the other way around"". With the dismissal of charges against the two East 84 gang members from Weston, the investigation became bogged down in conflicting testimony from members of the local criminal underworld. Marshall's associates in the Trey Eight Spliffs were increasingly looked at as having had involvement in the killing of Marshall. The police officer in charge was replaced with another agent from the Hartford Field Office, and the state police turned the investigation over to local law enforcement. On several occasions, the Marshall family attempted to have the case re-examined, and while it remains open to this day the murder is one of New England's most puzzling crimes.",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/Murder of Andre Marshall,1,hoax_archieved,"['Stephen Marshall (murderer)', 'Marion Wilson (murderer)', 'Murder of Jordan Davis', 'Stephen Marshall (writer)', 'Marshall (film)', 'Frederic Marshall (lawyer)', 'Murder of Ben Wilson', 'Robert Marshall (writer)', 'Sebastian Marshall', 'Murder of Jason Gage', 'Hall–Mills murder case', 'Alfred Marshall', 'Marion Marshall', 'Walter V.

Slow Blind Driveway," Slow Blind Driveway (March 19, 1885 in Jackson, Mississippi – April 19, 1952 in Deatsville, Alabama) was an American blues musician who was an influential guitarist, singer, and songwriter. He was born Clayton Taliaferro Driver or Clinton T. Driver, Jr. according to various sources (see references). Driveway was a blues vocalist and one of the earliest twelve-string finger picking guitarists, recording from 1927 to 1952. He was called ""slow"" in an ironic commentary on the rapidity of his playing. ""Driveway"" was a riff of his surname, and was related to the number of his songs about being on the road. One of his most famous songs, ""Back Road Blues"" has been covered by many artists including The Yardbirds and The Allman Brothers Band. In 1983, Jeff Lynne recorded a tribute song for Driveway, using the melody of ""Beal Street Infirmary Blues,""although the track was unreleased until 1991. Driveway had based his ""Dying Crapshooter's Blues"" on ""St. James Infirmary"". In 1993, Lynne paid further tribute to Driveway by recording his song ""Broke Down Engine. "" Born blind in one eye, Driveway lost his remaining vision by late childhood, but became a rapid reader of Braille. He demonstrated an inherent talent in music from an early age and learned to play the six-string guitar as a child. His father left the family when Driveway was still young, so when his mother died in the 1920s, he left his hometown and became a wandering busker. He began his recording career in 1927 for Victor Records in Jackson. In the years before World War II, he performed and traveled widely, recording under a variety of names for a number of different labels. His style was unique: a form of country blues, bridging the gap between the raw blues of the Mississippi Delta and the more refined Chicago sound. The style is documented on John Lomax's 1940 recordings of Driveway for the Library of Congress. After World War II, Driveway recorded for Atlantic Records and for Regal Records, but these recordings met with less commercial success than his previous works. He continued to perform live in Atlanta, but his continued career was cut short by ill health, predominantly diabetes. A record store manager, Chilton Pepper, met Driveway in 1951 and captured a few final performances on a tape recorder. Driveway died of heart failure in 1952. A blues festival in Driveway's honor is held annually in his birthplace. (Austria) BDCD-6901.

Mustelodon," Mustelodon is an extinct carnivore, which belongs to the family Viverravidae, a group of stem Carnivoramorpha. This genus contains only one species, Mustelodon primerus. Fossils of this mammal were found in the 57 million years old deposits of Lago Nandarajo, near the northern border of Panama in Central America. Mustelodon had a length of approximately 80 cm (head to tail) and this carnivore superficially resembled the modern mongooses. Mustelodon fed on fruits, insects and smaller mammals like shrews.

PH Games," PH Games is a tabletop game publisher in India, largely famous for the Revolution game series. It is also well known for other games, such as the Space Travels series, On the Run series, Devastation series and the Legend series, and for making tabletop games on sports such as Cricket and Football. Apart from the unconventional games mentioned above, PH also publishes traditional Role Playing Games, such as Mountain Dweller or The Lost Legacy. PH Games is the largest tabletop game publisher in India, and has so far developed games on three gameplay engine platforms: PH Games enjoyed a virtual monopoly, ruling the roost for nearly three years, until finally in 2006, Destruction Games emerged and snatched a huge chunk of the market share. Since then, PH has been constantly on its toes, trying to reclaim its erstwhile credibility and monopoly. The HG game engine was PH's first gameplay engine. It was characterised by the fact that it incorporated traditional, turn based, storytelling style gameplay, depending a lot on the game of luck, such as tossing a coin, or throwing the dice. This system also saw some of the greatest titles PH Games is known for, including: The HG system's lifespan was two years, from mid-2003 to mid-2005. The HG II game engine was PH's second game engine, and it incorporated some unconventional elements into tabletop gaming, such as non turn based gameplay, reaction time, real time storytelling and use of the environment (this was heavily publicised by PH as the Envir On Gameplay System). The HG II was also the period which saw the least amount of games coming from PH, and this negligence on their part paved the path to the rise of Destruction Games. Some popular games from PH using the HG II gameplay system were: Destruction Games also released several games using the HG II system (because they were unable to develop a gameplay system of their own). Some of the popular ones are: HG II had a liespan of two years from mid-2005 to mid-2007. B3YOND was PH's third gameplay engine, introduced in May 2007. It expanded on the unconventional gameplay elements of HG II, and introduced several new ones, such as Reflex Time and Two World Mechanic. As of October 2007, these are the popular games released using the B3YOND system: Apart from the games mentioned above, the following are expected to release soon: As of October 2007, PH is the largest tabletop publisher in India, with 50. 93% marketshare.

James Geiss," James Geiss (February 13, 1820 - August 30, 1878) was a noted nineteenth-century English businessman from Dover, Kent. His contributions to whaling were well-noted, and he was one of the last whaling tycoons in English history. Geiss's career began modestly as an apprentice on an English whaling boat at the age of sixteen, where he received his first taste of business on the open seas. Geiss was noted early on for his keen ability to calculate where the whales were most likely to congregate, and his predictions resulted in a marked increase in the profitability of several voyages. Armed with this ability and sound financial advice from his uncle, an economist, Geiss was able to rise steadily in the ranks of his company, gaining his first commission as a captain at the age of twenty-seven. Geiss changed his plans in 1854, when he resigned his commission to start the North Sea Whaling Company, his own enterprise, with four ships initially. Geiss's fortunes waxed considerably in the ensuing years, gaining a one-third market share of lamp oil sales. He competed successfully with Norwegian whalers in that area along with rival domestic companies. In 1862, at the peak of his enterprise, he owned sixty-seven ships making a total gross profit of over fifteen million pounds sterling. Unfortunately for Geiss, his fortunes did not last. Whaling entered a long decline, and his business ceased to be profitable. Geiss was forced to declare bankruptcy in 1874, and he died penniless in his home town of Dover four years later, one of the last true legends on the English whaling scene.",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/James Geiss,1,hoax_wikihoax_2023,"['James Geiss', 'Robert Geiss', 'James Geurts', 'James Geikie', 'Johannes Geiss', 'Anton Geiss', 'Bill Geiss', 'D.

Manão," Manão is a small medieval village perched on a mountain peak in Portugal some 50 miles west of the Spanish border. The fortress there, around which the village sprung, was built in 1277 as a base with which the Portuguese King, Dom Jiminex, could launch incursions against the Spanish Moors. This castle and the town surrounding it are at an altitude of over 1,300 metres above sea level. Easily accessible from Lisboa, Spain, and the Portuguese Algarve region, Manão has become something of a tourist favorite in Southern Europe, having attracted over 23,000 visitors in 2006, despite having a year-round population of only 231.

James and the Pontoons," James and the Pontoons are a British rock act formed in 1995 consisting of two core members, James Ragsway (guitar and vocals) and Jidge Johnson (Harpsichord) In early 1995, friends, James Ragsway and Jidge Johnson joined together to create the band James and the Pontoons. Originating from Bedford, UK, they went on to play such infamous venues as the Rames' Jazz Bar and Runway Club. Their first album, Make Me Up and Splooge, was an international flop and sold a mere 500 copies in the UK. Following their first flop, James and the Pontoons went on hiatus and took separate jobs. James Ragsway went on to take a teaching qualification exam in Computer Technology and Jidge Johnson went to pursue his dream of being a Curling Champion. In 2001 James and Jidge returned to the studio to continue their musical career and produced, Hand Me My Shotgun, Wem which was later released on 3 March 2002. Their new album, Hand Me My Shotgun, Wem (HMMSW) was an underground hit and although did not receive chart confirmation, they toured and sold out venues all around the UK. This then led into their third and last studio album, What the Heel?. What the Heel was released on 27 October 2004. This was also a relative flop and thus James and the Pontoons went on indefinite hiatus in 2005. In 1995 James and the Pontoons formed in James Ragsway's garage. Using an old harpsichord his mother owned, he and Jidge Johnson sat for hours improvising meaningless songs but never writing any proper music. James Ragway had always aspired to form a band and in late '95 began work on Make Me Up and Splooge. Ragsway's good friend Wem Wamsar (drummer 1995-1997) ran his own record label named after his pet dog, coincidentally named Jidge. The band would always class this as a running joke through their tours, referring to Jidge as ""The Dog of Destiny"". James and the Pontoons spent exactly three days in the studio recording Make Me Up and Splooge, thus why the album was a complete flop. The recording quality was poor, as it was recorded on an old 4-track mixer. The band went on a tour in the UK with their album from 1996. Unfortunately it was cut short due to the drummer, Wem Wamsar committing suicide due to matters at home, which are still unknown. This had a huge effect on the band and they vowed never to play again, unless in Wem's memory. They played their final memorial concert on 23rd October 1998 and he band went on hiatus. James returned to his Computer Tech course, while Jidge took up his hobby of curling. In late 2001 both remaining members James and Jidge received news that a terrorist attack on 11th September 2001 had taken the lives of former drummer Wem's parents. In light of the vow they made, both James and Jidge decided to reunite and record the ironically titled ""Hand Me My Shotgun, Wem"". This was an ironic twist as it was a shotgun that Wem had committed suicide with. Jidge returned playing his original studio harpsichord, while James tried out more experimental instruments such as synthisisers, violins, guitars and the banjo. They had also acquired a new drummer named Sanguello Marino who originally played in a jazz band called ""The Sasquas"". Their most well known song from this album is ""Same PE Choices"" in which the band reminisce about their early childhood and formation of the band. This goes deeply into the personal thoughts and life of Wem shortly before suicide. For example one line is ""You ran away and hid, No one knew you ever did. Now you scream to hear our voices, and our PE choices"". The phrase ""PE Choices"" refers to the early days where James would ask Jidge and Wem what choices they had chosen for Physical Education. This was by far the most successful album receiving a total of 300,000 sales in the UK. However the album never went mainstream, therefore never entering the UK Album Charts. James and Jidge continued to tour with their new album playing smaller, more intimate venues where they could talk to the audience about the meaning of the album. Though some of their earlier songs from ""Make Me Up and Splooge"" were not recognised they received thousands of new fans and their first album sales went through the roof. They ended the tour with a final gig in their hometown of Bedford where they played three newly written songs, exclusively. These songs were never professionally recorded and released, however there are many bootleg copies to be found on the internet. These songs included ""Abraham"", ""Midge Sweep Me Off My Feet"" and ""Let's Talk about M-E-N"". This last song came as an enlightenment to most fans revealing James Ragsway to be a homosexual. This to most people was very obvious due to most of James' past encounters with his relationships falling apart with many women. The tour ended with confirmation of a new album to the fans and thus ended the era of ""Hand Me My Shotgun, Wem. The band then returned to the studio to record their third studio album.",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/James and the Pontoons,1,hoax_wikihoax_2023,"['John and James (1792 ship)', 'John and James (1796 ship)', 'Cumberland Pontoons', 'The ships Anne and Little James', 'Pont Books', 'James Battle (fireboat)', 'James (ship)', 'John Pont', 'Pontings', 'Pontarsais', 'Pontyclun', 'Pontllanfraith', 'Pontoon (song)', 'Pontenure', 'Pontorson', 'John James (pirate)', 'John and James Woolf', 'James of Avesnes', 'Pontycymer', 'John du Pont', 'James and Mary Wallis', 'James II of Avesnes', 'PontAuRail', 'James Robins', 'James Mates', 'Pontage', 'James Likeness', 'The New James', 'James and Penninah Wrathall House', 'Pontoon boat', 'Lake As Pontes', 'Robert Pont', 'James Cartlidge', 'Epistle of James', 'James Britten', 'Pontassieve', 'James Ferry', 'James Comet', 'Walter Ponting', 'Pontsticill', 'Pontis', 'James and Tom Martin', 'HMS James (1634)', 'Pontus Holmberg', 'List of ships named John and James', 'Simon Pontdemé', 'Pontfaverger-Moronvilliers', 'Elis James and John Robins', 'James 2', 'William Ponting', 'Samuel Francis Du Pont', 'James the Great', 'The Full Ponty', 'James A.

Bicholim conflict," The Bicholim Conflict of 1640–1641 was a period of armed conflict between the Portuguese rulers of Goa and the Maratha Empire led by Shivaji Bhonsle in the northern regions of Goa, particularly in the Bicholim region. The conflict lasted from mid-1640 to early 1641, when the Maratha Confederacy and the Portuguese signed a treaty by which they would respect the pre-existing Maratha–North Goa boundary. However, the conflict continued to cause tension between the Maratha rulers and the Portuguese in Goa and the islands of Daman and Diu. While the conflict mainly remained localised to Northern Goa, at one point anti-Portuguese uprisings occurred in the neighbouring regions of Pernem and Bardez. Portuguese traders set up Goa as their first trading port in India in 1498, when Vasco da Gama created a route through Goa. By 1542, the areas of Velhas Conquistas were enjoying higher elements of prosperity. Those that converted to Christianity were given extra privileges in comparison with those that opted to remain Hindu or Muslim. In 1560, the Goa Inquisition was established and 4,000 people were arrested for heresy in the first few years alone. The neighbouring Hindu regions, particularly those to the north of Goa and those in the Novas Conquistas, felt a great deal of apprehensiveness towards the newly established inquisition. Although Goa slowly grew in its splendour during this time, the Marathas to the north exhibited more expansionist growth. Between 1603 and 1639, the Dutch fleet blockaded Goa, as part of the Dutch-Portuguese War, cutting it off to supplies from Portugal and forcing the inhabitants of Goa into desperate poverty. The Dutch and Portuguese were at war as a result of Dutch attempts to seize Portuguese colonies to add to its expanding empire. At the same time, Shivaji Bhonsle began his series of conquests which would eventually lead to the creation of the Maratha Empire. In 1635, the Maratha Empire and Portuguese Goa gained a common border. Aware of the growth of the Marathas and forcibly experiencing a widespread famine, many inhabitants in North Goa expressed their support for the Marathas. Others also accepted Maratha immigrants into their village, particularly those from the influential region of Kolhapur, which bordered Goa. In 1639, in the same year when the Dutch blockade was lifted, a treaty was signed between the Marathas and Mysore, forbidding either of the parties to oppose the other in any way and ensuring that both parties accepted their common border. The Marathas had also offered a type of protectorate status to the remaining Deccan states. The only part of their southern frontier which was not secured as peaceful was that with Portuguese Goa, which the Marathas conveniently surrounded from the north and the east. In January 1640, the Marathas attempted a negotiation with the Portuguese Governor-General established in Goa. Governor-General Matias de Albuquerque was reluctant to confront the Maratha Empire, particularly because of the external political pressures playing on him. The inquisitors had great influence in Portuguese Goa's administration in those times and conducting negotiations with the largely Hindu Maratha Empire would be considered a betrayal to the cause. The message evidently got to the Marathas, who began redirecting troops from the peaceful Mysore frontier to the border with Goa. Albuquerque finally agreed to a meeting with a representative from the Maratha Empire, but no resolutions were reached. The Marathas, who were committed to secularism, especially condemned the treatment of Hindus in Goa and pointed to the burning at the stake of Hindus who allegedly committed heresy through their actions. The inconclusive result of this meeting was one of the major causes of the later confrontations. By the beginning of the 1640 Goan summer (i. e. February–March 1640), Albuquerque had ordered the maintenance of a Portuguese presence amongst Goan villages in Pernem and Bicholim. Suspicious of this action, a minor troop build-up along the border between the Maratha Empire and Bicholim was ordered by the Marathas. The borders were not particularly fortified as there had never been an external land threat to Goa before. The governor of the Bicholim region was a native Goan Christian convert named Nicolau de Mello. Mello was a trusted governor and reasonably popular amongst his subjects. According to David D'Souza, a Goan historian, Hindu members of the Bicholim community considered Mello to have an anti-Hindu bias and were more ready to side with the Marathas. Vasantakulan Srinivasan is more inclined to believe that the Hindus were not aware of the Maratha presence and, although ruffled by their mistreatment, were loyal to Mello. The Marathas wanted a secure southern frontier but members of the Goan inquisitorial forces were reluctant to negotiate with them. At one point there was discussion of advancing the Portuguese navy north to launch an invasion of the Kolhapur region and, in doing so, remove the threat the Marathas had on Novas Conquistas. The plan was rejected as it could have triggered escalation and thus open up the chance that the Marathas would ally with the Dutch to fight against the Portuguese. The actual start of the conflict was triggered at Ibrampur, a small town in the Pernem district which was located near important roads and the source of the Chapora River. The Maratha forces at the Bicholim border were allegedly tipped off by an informant claiming a buildup of Portuguese forces at Ibrampur. However, at that time, the Portuguese forces were actually based at a fort in Alorna, which was further away from the border. The Marathas crossed the traditional border and led a cavalry expedition to Ibrampur so as to scout the area. When the Portuguese were not found, their commander assumed that they were yet to come and it was decided that it would be necessary to fortify Ibrampur before Portuguese arrival. The Portuguese forces, led at Bicholim and Pernem by Manuel de Elaminos, were notified of the Marathain incursion and reported the invasion to Vasco da Gama, Goa. They moved down the road to Ibrampur, leaving Alorna defenceless, in order to attack the Marathas at Ibrampur. The Portuguese attack in August 1640 was swift and effective. The two main paths out of Ibrampur, those to the north and to the west, were both surrounded. To avoid too much damage, the Portuguese opened their attack on the city with a wave of infantry. While only light casualties were inflicted on the infantry, they retreated after seeing the size of the built-up Maratha forces. Evidently, the Marathas believed they had the upper hand and decided to push the Portuguese back along the road to Alorna. The Marathain cavalry chased the retreating infantry back to their line of offence. Continued engagement led to the call-up of the Portuguese forces stationed north of Ibrampur to come to the west and help in the battle. The relatively minor contingent of Portuguese in the northern side was, however, cut off by Maratha infantry advancing from Ibrampur. Thus by the end of the first day of battle there were two fronts for the troops. Casualties had been low, as clever manoeuvring by the Portuguese in the west had meant that they could carry out an organised retreat. Nonetheless, the Portuguese had suddenly become aware of the intensity of the conflict and the strength of the Marathas. They were also made forcibly aware that the residents of Ibrampur accepted and allowed Marathain fortifications to be built around their town and believed the Hindu-majority town might have been a bad influence on other towns around the frontier. After two days of the Maratha push towards Alorna, reinforcements from Vasco da Gama, Goa reached the troops. The balancing of numbers meant that the Portuguese could stop the push. After another day of manoeuvring, the forces reached a stalemate and did not move from their positions for the next week. Neither side wished to escalate the conflict by taking risks and sustaining casualties. Both sides sought to use offence as a method for defence. The Maratha troops had inflicted casualties early on the first two days of battle, which had triggered the retreat towards Alorna, but had remained subdued, using their cavalry advantage to outmanoeuvre the Portuguese as opposed to charging onto them. In early July, the Portuguese received permission to use artillery, as they had fallen far away from Ibrampur. The artillery was effective in subduing the infantry, although it inflicted very few casualties. Continued fire on the Marathain cavalry led to the decision to quickly retreat out of artillery range. They assumed that they would be able to regroup further away from Alorna and then use their speed to out-flank the enemy south of the road and cause a devastating blow to their artillery. The Portuguese had a technological advantage and the Marathas were forced to adapt to this new enemy. The Portuguese quickly opted to split their forces and try to flank the Marathas in their return. The unsuspecting Marathas were hit hard by the Portuguese counter-flanking and were forced to move even further south, further towards the Chapora River. When the Maratha cavalry reached the Chapora, they decided to retreat back into Maratha-controlled territory, trying to lure the Portuguese out of their strategic positions within Goa, however, the Portuguese did not even follow them down to the source of the Chapora. By the end of July, the Marathas had regrouped in their territory and the Portuguese had fortified Alorna under the leadership of Alberto Pinto, who diversified troop positions north of the Chapora. At this point both sides were convinced that a show of force would be required to settle the dispute. The Marathas still believed that the Portuguese had been moving troops to Ibrampur to invade Maratha territory and the Portuguese wanted to create a buffer zone between Goa and the Maratha Empire, possibly by seizing Kolhapur to the north, although it was never clear whether this was a rumour or a plan. Pernem was situated in a region which was surrounded by Maratha land from the north and east and was thus considered by both sides as the area which was most likely to come under the line of war. The Marathas abandoned their earlier plan to secure Pernem and moved south to Bicholim. Bicholim was not as heavily defended by troops but was more central and easier to reach from Panjim. The Marathas entered Bicholim in mid August and took a route through the vast farmland and fields in the north of the region, south of the Chapora. The Maratha presence remained unreported by locals, who were either fooled to ignore the Marathas or persuaded to side with the Marathas. In late August, Maratha infantry attackeded Kansarpal and Latambarcem, and a smaller force nearby Sal. Both towns were important Hindu religious and cultural locations. The Hindu majority area did not provide much resistance and no casualties occurred as the Marathas began to fortify the town as a forward base. It took a week until news of the occupation reached Nicolau de Mello in the Bicholim town and even longer for it to reach Vasco da Gama and the forces at Alorna and Ibrampur. Maratha forces secured the major road which ran from Dodamarg to the border with Bardez and all regions between the road and the Chapora were considered Marathi. On the 10 September, Portuguese troops crossed the Chapora river via a bridge west of Alorna. Reconnaissance found Maratha infantry patrolling the southern banks and thus the crossing occurred in the middle of night. A night attack also meant that artillery were rendered ineffective or too dangerous. After making stealthy progress though the night, the Portuguese attacked a Marathi post north of Kansarpal at daybreak. The Maratha patrols flanked the Portuguese who surrendered their weapons. This defeat was pivotal in the course of the conflict: the Portuguese lost their advantage in munitions and many troops which had earlier pushed the Marathas out of Goa and had also abandoned artillery in Alorna. The Marathas launched another attack from the border with an attack on Maulinguem. Again, the attack was successful with only minimal fighting due to the acceptance of the Marathas by the Hindu majority in the town. Portuguese troops were stationed in Bicholim town, Lamgao, Mulgaon, and Vathadeo as well as the borders between the Maratha Empire and Satari. The Portuguese refrained from an attack directly on the Marathas stationed in Bicholim, as they were aware that the people of Bicholim did not oppose the Marathas. The towns which they had fortified and protected the most had fewer Hindus and were thus less susceptible to easy takeover. When the October attack on Vathadeo came, a battle commenced. The Battle for Vathadeo was short yet had great implications on the Portuguese defence of Goa. Vathadeo was a strategic point which the Marathas felt necessary to capture before advancing on to the Bicholim town. The Portuguese had placed necessary fortifications around it, although the relatively small village did not have any static defences. Albert Pinto was called from Pernem to Bicholim so that he could defend Vathadeo. The Maratha attack came, as expected, from the north, and the Portuguese immediately bombarded them with artillery fire. Maratha cavalry dispersed in face of the fire and the infantry suffered light casualties as it continued its advance. The Portuguese artillery were inaccurate and did not have an effect on the cavalry. As the Portuguese formed a standard line of defence around the northern side of Vathadeo, the Maratha infantry confronted them, with the aim of engaging them in close combat while the cavalry could out-flank them and cause casualties. The engagement occurred, but the Portuguese immediately broke through the Maratha line of offence and caused heavy casualties. The Maratha strategy was in tatters as the Maratha infantry suffered heavy casualties. Inefficient ordering by commanders led to the cavalry allowing the Portuguese counter-attack to continue for some time before going in to stop it. The fierce battle at the northern edge of Vathadeo was one of the heaviest and most intense fights in the conflict, with the constant fighting in equal numbers lasting for most of the day. Eventually, with the onset of darkness, Pinto ordered the Portuguese troops to stop their forward push and come back to Vathadeo. The details of casualties in that battle were never described in Portuguese or Marathi histories but have been assumed to be fairly high. David D'Souza, however, claims the reasoning behind this is because at the end of the conflict, the number of casualties suffered in this battle could have been the determining factor over who had come out with the upper hand and both sides were afraid to concede their equally high casualties. On the next day, the Maratha forces attacked once again from the north, just before dawn, so that they did not have to manoeuvre or encounter the artillery. The attack started successfully but was again in tatters after dawn with Pinto showing military prowess in turning the tide and once again pushing the Marathas north, albeit with much less casualties and much more clever manoeuvring. However, this time the Maratha cavalry managed to escape from engagement and travel south into Vathadeo to confront the troops remaining in the town. The Portuguese surrendered in Vathadeo with the onset of a great cavalry attack, although the majority of their forces were within vision of the remainder of the Portuguese forces. Pinto, upon becoming aware of the white flag being raised, was enraged and organised a retreat back to Vathadeo. However, his retreat was organised so that his troops received minimal casualties and for that reason it took him until night to get back to the town. The Marathas were outnumbered but were strategically placed to confront Pinto's forces. However, more manoeuvring outside the town saw the Maratha cavalry forced to the north of Vathadeo. With both sides scenting victory, the fighting continued throughout the night. Eventually, the fatigued Portuguese retreated to positions within the southern end of the town and fortified it, allowing the Marathas to take the northern end. While the town had been split into two, the civilians were freely allowed movement between the two sides by the Marathas. Sensing ulterior motives, Pinto ordered a section of his troops to maintain a curfew-type check on the homes of the town's residents, particularly those of a high-caste Hindu background. It was suggested that these civilians may rally to the Maratha cause if they went to the north and spoke to the Maratha troops. Their suspicions were partially correct, as on the next afternoon, with the two sides at a stalemate, a group of civilians from the north attempted to steal Portuguese weapons. They were caught in the act and brutally imprisoned for treason and sent back to Vasco da Gama. However, rumours of this action quickly spread and civil unrest led to the Portuguese being forced to clamp down on movement in the southern part of the town. David D'Souza claims that the rumours were exaggerated by the Marathas. Nevertheless, the contrasting appearance of the north and south sides of the city caused unrest. In the north, the Marathas allowed free movement and the civilians carried a business-as-usual attitude while in the south, but for a few privileged and influential families, most of the civilians were forced to remain indoors. On the next day, the Marathas launched an infantry offensive and gained ground until the Portuguese forces grouped together and pushed back the infantry. The Marathas could have made more ground but cleverly spent time going house to house and informing residents that they were free. When the Portuguese regained the territories, they ordered civilians back into their homes. Instead of going back, the civilians opposed the troops and began a riot which rocked the south of Vathadeo. With many Portuguese containing the riots, the Marathas struck again in the night and a short but decisive battle ensued, in which the Marathas cornered Portuguese forces into a small area in the south-west of the town. Pinto ordered his troops to retreat to the road south of Vathadeo to lay siege on the city on the next morning. The troops received renewed orders from Vasco da Gama, telling them to not let Vathadeo out of their sights. After two days, they cut off supply routes to the city. The Portuguese even cut off inhabitants from their outlying farming regions, leaving them without food and unprepared for a siege-type procedure. By early November, civilians began leaving Vathadeo and submitting to the Portuguese. Some were accused of treason and were arrested, others from the mainly Catholic Portuguese factional families were allowed free exit. The Marathas had been pushed into a situation in which they could not afford to send any more troops to fight. Contrary to their previous invasions, which had been relatively swift and effective, they were taking a long time to combat the Portuguese technological advantages. Their forces were now under siege in Vathadeo and they did not want to suffer many casualties, so they decided to wait for the situation to change. However, news of the arrests and curfews placed on the Hindu population in Vathadeo spread quickly throughout the Goan country-side. In early December, the rumours had been exaggerated into stories of a massacre at Vathadeo of people who were allegedly allied with the Marathas. The first major show of dissent was back at Ibrampur, which had earlier accepted the Marathas but was now under heavy fortification by the Portuguese. The inhabitants of Ibrampur left work and attempted to fight Portuguese troops. Their lack of weaponry however meant that the Portuguese frightened many with shots in the air and could imprison the troublemakers in the town without causing damage. Anconem, which was north of Ibrampur, also suffered a similar fate. However, when inhabitants of the small village of Tatradingam, just north of the Alorna fort, marched over to the fort demanding that the Portuguese surrender Pernem to Maratha forces, a small fight ensued. Portuguese representatives achieved no compromise with the villagers, who forced themselves into the fort. Facing a military base infiltration, the commander at the fort took discretion to injure a few of the civilians. The over-zealous troops caused fatal wounds on a large portion of the villagers, who were unable to treat the wounds in time. De Albequerque saw this as an effective measure in defending military bases and did not condemn it. In Bicholim, the city's residents flocked to the government house held by Mello to demand an end to the massacres. D'Mello controversially instructed the troops in the city to organise a curfew. The curfew was extended to all areas in Bicholim with a high troop density. Another uprising at Sirigao resulted in the whole Bicholim region (the parts that were still held by the Portuguese) being put under a state of emergency. The eastern end of Pernem was also placed under a state of military emergency. In late December, with Christmas approaching, a small band of five to ten Hindus in Dravidna in Bardez set fire to homes in the city, claiming that they were liberating Goa and giving it to the Marathas. The attack led to a nasty reprisal in Dravidna, with Portuguese troops rounding up the gang and other alleged co-conspirators and publicly sentencing them to death. In the onset of the new year, the Portuguese made an offensive at Maulinguem, which had a small contingent of Marathas controlling it. The attack was successful and the Portuguese took the town with minimal casualties. Again, some civilians were arrested for alleged treason. The Portuguese troops advanced to regain their lost land in Bicholim. The Maratha troops began surrendering and leaving Goa. However, more Maratha troops regrouped at the border, causing the prospect of another invasion. The only Maratha presence within Goa itself was at Vathadeo. Even there, the two month siege was beginning to cause unrest amongst even the most staunch of Maratha supporters. The last blow for the Marathas at Vathadeo was the alleged sabotage of the food stores. The Maratha forces were not prepared to let their only defended town starve to death and thus raised the white flag of surrender in late January 1641. The Portuguese were apprehensive at first and readied themselves for battle, but Maratha troops began exiting the town in small groups so as to be harmless. The Portuguese, for their part, allowed troops free passage out of the town, but arrested those troops which did not immediately surrender their arms to the Portuguese. It is speculated by Srinivasan Vasantakulan that if the Marathas had opted to fight the Portuguese, they would have lost due to malnourishment and dwindling morale. The Portuguese also outnumbered the Marathas in the town, as they had been quickly reinforced. In early February, Maratha troops once again entered Ibrampur, but this time they gave a message to the Portuguese seeking to negotiate the release of the Maratha prisoners and an end to the brutalities against civilians who were alleged to have been Maratha sympathizers. Shivaji himself was granted an audience with Albuquerque to negotiate a treaty under which the Marathas would accept the standing de facto border between the Maratha Empire and the Portuguese colony of Goa and would respect it as a border between princely states. The Portuguese similarly conceded that they would make no attempts to conduct any expansion north of the boder. The motives for making such a treaty were many. The Marathas needed the troops captured at Vathadeo reinstated into their forces. The Marathas were also unsure as to whether they could push into Goa as swiftly as earlier assumed and decided it would be better to secure the southern frontier as originally planned as opposed to continuing a war in the south. With this treaty, the entire southern stretch of inter-nation-state boundary for the Maratha Empire was secured as peaceful through treaty. For the Portuguese, there were immense fears that the uprising in Bicholim and Pernem could spread to other regions and could increasingly aid the Marathas. They were also very much aware that the Marathas had a large amount of reinforcements building up near the de facto border. They were afraid that a simultaneous uprising and Maratha invasion would see much of North Goa fall into Maratha hands and might even threaten Pangim and Vasco da Gama, Goa. The Marathas had shown when offering their treaty that they could threaten Ibrampur again without much resistance. Some Goans were let down by the treaty, unhappy that they lost the chance to become part of the Maratha expansion. However, most of them were happy with the way the treaty was negotiated and satisfied that they would not be subject to unfair treatment once the Maratha Empire and Portuguese Goa were peaceful. The conflict did not stop uprisings in Goa, but limited them immensely. It must also be noted that the reason this conflict is not known as a war is because neither side ever declared that they were in a state of open war with each other, although the Marathas and Portuguese were actively preparing to battle each other. It is because of this monumental peace treaty and the resulting confidence between the Marathas and Portuguese that the Maratha Empire never expanded southwards to Goa, even when it was at its peak. For this reason, Portugal maintained its control over Goa, which eventually became part of the Union of India in 1961. Modern-day Goa has its own government, culture and enjoys the autonomy of a state in the Indian Union. The conflict was fairly brief and its impact in terms of casualties and damage was minimal. For this reason, it has not become much of a talking point amongst filmmakers and bookwriters. A 1921 fiction book by Frank McCallas on rebellion in India bore notable similarities to the events of the Bicholim conflict. Another book in 1958 by Goan writer Victor D'Souza entitled ""Goan Life"" presented a story about a Christian family living in a village which had given up allegiance to the Marathas, which was possibly inspired by the events during the conflict.

George K. Broomhall," George K. Broomhall was a brevet general in the Union Army during the American Civil War. Originally from the town of Wayne, Maine, Broomhall is widely credited with the invention of cream soda. Broomhall is generally considered to be Wayne's most famous resident. Broomhall never set foot in the ""State of Maine,"" having enlisted in the military in 1817, training at Annapolis, Maryland, and eventually settling in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, after hostilities ended. He never returned to Wayne. (Maine became a state on March 15, 1820, after he moved away. It was part of Massachusetts when Broomhall lived there. ) He is buried at Gott Cemetery on Gott Road in Wayne next to his wife Amelia, daughter Josephine, and son Augustus. The four were originally buried in Mount Joy, Pennsylvania, but the bodies were exhumed in 1889 for Wayne's centennial festivities and brought to their current resting place. A small memorial was also erected there. {{DEFAULTSORT:Broomhall, George K. }} ] ] ] ] ] ] ] {{US-army-bio-stub}} {{food-bio-stub}} {{AmericanCivilWar-bio-stub}}",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/George K.

Colby Pirates," The Colby Pirates were a group of pirates that operated as privateers at the peak of the hostilities between Britain and France during the French and Indian war. They operated for the British King George III in the Great Lakes frontier of the British North American colonies. In the late 18th century, they were led by George Colby. Unlike the pirates of the Spanish and Caribbean seas, the Colby Pirates operated largely without large and fast ships, using mock light houses to cause unsuspecting French merchant ships to run aground, making them easy prey. Once stranded, the Colby Pirates used small vessels to plunder the cargo of the helpless French ships. After the signing of the Treaty of Paris, King George III officially disbanded the Colby Pirates, revoking their status as privateers as their service to the Crown was no longer needed. This action is the last known record of the Colby Pirates, and it is assumed that they were assimilated into British settlements in the Great Lakes region.",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/Colby Pirates,1,hoax_wikihoax_2023,"['Colby', 'John Colby', 'The Colbys', 'Colby Robak', 'Colby Bishop', 'Chuck Colby', 'Colby Genoway', 'Colby Mules', 'Colby (given name)', 'Colby Pearson', 'Colby Carthel', 'Jeff Colby', 'James Colby', 'Person Colby Cheney', 'Colby O', 'Colby-Jack', 'Colby Howard', 'Colby cheese', 'Colby, Isle of Man', 'Colbyn', 'William Colby', 'Colby Vokey', 'Colby Coash', 'Colby Fire', 'Colby Mansion', 'Strait Pirates', 'Chasing Pirates', 'Everett Colby', 'Royal Pirates', 'Frank Moore Colby', 'Kenneth Colby', 'Hunter Pirates', 'Scarborough Pirates', 'Colby Covington', 'Gerard Colby', 'Colby Quinones', 'Colby Cave', 'Colby Cohen', 'Michael Colby', 'Colby Slater', 'C.

Olimar The Wondercat," Olimar the Wondercat was a short-lived children's television programme made by the BBC in the 1970s. It featured a cat called Olimar with magical powers. Two series, each with six programmes, were made. In the early 1980s the rights to Olimar the Wondercat were bought by LWT and his name was shortened to Oli the Wondercat. The programme was redesigned giving Oli a costume and enhanced special powers. In true ITV style Oli had a nemesis Evil Derek the Dark Dalmatian (more spot than dog) who plagued Oli. However, Evil Derek's role as villain was soon usurped by Cello the Mighty, a fierce Siamese cat embodying the truculence and pugnacity of his homeland - Canada. Cello and Oli battled many times with Cello countering Oli's strange magical powers with his ability to grow a lion-like and power-granting mane at will. Cello's struggles with Oli would dominate most of the Series 2 plot line. In a surprising twist, Cello defeats his nemesis Oli in the finale. He would go on to live forever and be proclaimed King of all Cats. LWT sought to maximise their newly acquired rights to Oli the Wondercat and sold the rights on the French television channel TF1 in the early 1980s. The original video was kept intact, but the audio was not only dubbed into French, but the storylines were significantly altered to suit European tastes. Despite Derek being voiced by Serge Gainsbourg, the French version was a flop and was dropped after only four episodes. A spin-off entitled Kismet the Cute! would air for 8 seasons following the end of Olimar the Wondercat.",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/Olimar The Wondercat,1,hoax_wikihoax_2023,"['Wonderboy Nxumalo', 'Captain Olimar', 'Wonderla', 'Wonderama', 'Princess Olala', 'Wonder Gadot', 'Ollur', 'Unseen Wonder', 'The Wonder Who?', 'Ọlọrun', 'Wonderlustre', 'Young Wonder', 'Olof Hiorter', 'Wonder in the World', 'Wonderhouse', 'Oľka', 'Hanna Rún Óladóttir', 'Wonder (film)', 'Öllölä', 'The Wonder Stuff', 'The Wonder (horse)', 'Ölper', 'Olperer', 'Olmazar', 'Oltenița', 'The Olongapo Caper', 'Wonder Wonder', 'Wonder Boy in Monster World', 'Olost', 'Wonderchild', 'Yonie Wondernose', 'Olbia', 'Oliana', 'Ollolai', 'Dora Olivo', 'Wonderfontein', 'Peter the Wonderworker', 'Ola Obarska', 'Olivo', 'Wonder Nine', 'The Wonder (album)', 'Olikovo', 'Wonder Girl', 'OLAT', 'Wonder Boy (character)', 'Ollach', 'Olsker', 'Olunloyo', 'Olusegun Olusola', 'The Bringers of Wonder, Part One', 'Olivo Barbieri', 'Petrus Olai', 'Olzai', 'Watseka Wonder', 'Malini Olivo', 'Olszowice', 'Gabriel Olutola', 'Princess Olufemi-Kayode', 'Disney Wonder', 'Olufela Olomola', 'Wonder Boy', 'Olivola', 'Oligospira', 'Morpho aurora', 'Olofi', 'Wonderama (album)', 'The Wonder Spot', 'Ollepa', 'The Wonder Kid', 'Olla (film)', 'Olcay Gür', 'Wonderfruit', 'Olowu', 'Jordan Olowofela', 'Ollei', 'Olyva', 'Olinguito', 'State of Wonder', 'Olaine', 'Mooncat', 'Wonder Momo', 'Olite', 'Wonderbra', 'Olpuch', 'Ollacheryphe', 'Olla', 'The Marvelous Wonderettes', 'The Bringers of Wonder, Part Two', 'Olonka', 'Tir Ollíol', 'Olmediella', 'Olmen', 'Anatomy of Wonder', 'Lady Wonder', 'Olubadan', 'Olomouc', 'Olorua', 'The Age of Wonder', 'Aurora Zeka', 'Rex the Wonder Dog']"
K890," The K890 is a unique submachine gun that was manufactured as a prototype during the 1950s.

Avlor Landić de Hazelrof," Avlor Landic de Hazelrof, a Marxian economist, was born in Varaždin, capital of the County of Varaždin, present-day Croatia, November 15, 1898, and died December 23, 1972 in Managua. He was a long time associate of the Chinese Communists. His father, Zag Landic de Hazelrof, was of Coatian and Serbian origin; his mother, Aferdita Bulezim, was Albanian. When his parents were murdered by members of the Young Bosnia movement, he fled to Thessaloniki. At the age of 14 years, he sailed as a cabin boy, starting this job at the port of Piraeus. During three years, he crossed the oceans, mainly on shipping lines to Asia. In 1916, the ship on which he sailed was requisitioned by the administration in charge of the French Concession in Shanghai, in order to convey Chinese workers bound for Europe to overcome the lack of staff in the munitions factories there. Laid off, he found a job as a groom at the Palace Hotel on the Bund, owned by Sir Victor Sassoon. During this period, he learned Mandarin while attending the Tongmenghui, formerly secret society, founded by Sun Yat-Sen. He also began relationships with revolutionary leaders such as Liu Shaoqi. In 1921, he joined the foreign section of the Communist Party of China (Zhongguo Gòngchǎndǎng) by then mainly composed by Jews from Russia and Poland, and attended the first party congress in July 1921 held in the French Concession in Shanghai. During this period, he acquired the Chinese name Jun mǎ (俊 马) Writing and speaking perfect Mandarin, he was a great reader, feeding himself with Marxist and classic economic literature, in particular, Adam Smith, David Ricardo and Daniel Bernoulli. He translated into Mandarin the Adam Smith masterpiece, Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations. In a remarkable insight, in 1925 he already considered that the international division of labor would work in favor of China. In the thirties, he was the author of several studies where he portrayed a systematic segmentation of the Chinese provinces based on their industrial and agricultural comparative advantages. He suggested their specialization, all tightly controlled by a centralized and an authoritarian government. ""With this approach, he argues, China will have an absolute authority to set its domination over the world. In addition to raw materials, the entire chain of agricultural and industrial production should be concentrated in China. This is the condition of absolute independence that China will make its voice heard without any fear"" from what he called “centripetal imperialism”. His ideas were to be highlighted at the onset of the first Five-Year Plan in the early fifties, and then as major directions in the sixth plan, (1981-1985), and since including into the preamble of each plan. de Hazelrof is best known for his predictions in economics. Based on an acute knowledge of Chinese astrology, they correlate the existence of business cycles with the scientific movement of the constellations. In his second book,The agiométrie space, he makes predictions, detailing each of the closer things to come. Although mundane reasons cause crises, they actually occur when the conjunction of the stars is unfavorable. Most of his predictions proved correct. He would have expected the economic shocks which raged during the Maoist China. Above all, he sees around the years 2010-2020, an unprecedented crisis. According to him, the balance of the stars which turned the general collapse of Western economies is expected. Interpretation of his ideas varies. In an essay,The exhaustion of the poet, the Jesuit priest, Bernard Renaud Von Jacquemol said that de Hazelrof was ""cruelly good at predicting a future all too cruel. "" Dominicans father, Philippe Poiget, predictions of Avlor Landice Hazelrof not opposed to itself. ""Nothing he does say the least grain of truth. It is required of the ideas he is the only one to believe! ""This position is challenged by the militant secular Denis Thevenin which ensures that the predictions of de Hazelrof dismantle the whole system of belief. According to him, there would be the ""before and after Avlor. The late scholar has liquidated the stroke of a pen once and for all beliefs in a God supra natural. This avalanche of nonsense that has lasted for millennia grotesque hampers the ability of man to stand up against the dictates of nature wild and hopeless. "" ""Now that the Earth is dying a slow death,"" says the historian Jean Pierre Razafy, ""we can no longer tell stories! If man had not a dusty head with all sorts of quirky ideas, he would already be in the vicinity of the Orion Nebula. "" Religions is the bitch of the people! pushes the Japanese playwright. Instead of focusing only on their self, people allowed themselves to be possessed by a false good at their beautiful singing all sorts of nonsense. "" For the Australian business woman, Gina Jones, it is money and power that led man to create religions, an ideal instrument to enslave and dominate. ""The poet Bruno Cuello exclaims,"" When will we be done with this idiocy? "" This almost deification of Avlor led the sculptor, Philippa Holland, to make a 20-foot high statue of him in the center of Derby. However, the Chinese translator Ying Zhuang rejects this analysis. According to the latter, de Hazelrof had no intention to deal with in religious considerations. ""This is an interpretation! Avlor is a noble person as a friend of the Chinese people. Fascinated with history, distant to the event, not worried about a vain need to posterity.

Aliquota," The Aliquota (Aliquotae Tecla) is a reptile of the family Aliquotae. The male Aliquota, easily recognized by his mane, weighs between 150-225 kg (330-500 lb) and females range 120-150 kg (260-330 lb). In the wild, Aliquotas live for around 10–14 years, while in captivity they can live over 20 years. It is presently encountered in the wild only in Accisa. The famous Davide's ""Aliquota di Accisa"" can be found at Accisa's National Park. The skin of the Aliquota is usually Green and Brown, but when it is in the fertility period, its skin can takes some Blue shading.",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/Aliquota,1,hoax_wikihoax_2023,"['Alimqul', 'Alilem', 'Alivalam', 'Alipin', 'Aliquot sum', 'Aligider', 'Aequorin', 'Aliquli Jabbadar', 'Alimestan', 'Alimpashayurt', 'Alifushi', 'Alisma', 'Alisarda', 'Aliqtisadi', 'Alipada', 'Alimodian', 'Alioranus', 'Alitame', 'Alipiri', 'Alipashiad', 'Aliatypus', 'Aliweb', 'Alistra', 'Alirocumab', 'Alita', 'Alimabad', 'Aliciella', 'Alincthun', 'Asror Aliqulov', 'Alioramus', 'Alingo', 'Aliminusa', 'Alimamy Sesay', 'Aliyasantana', 'Alimukku', 'Alípio', 'Aligudarz', 'Adavalle Aligithe', 'Alikiona', 'Alimosho', 'Aliskiren', 'Aliyudin Ali', 'Alikhoja', 'Alinaqipalem', 'Alikulular', 'Alima', 'Alifeira', 'Aliaksandr Subota', 'Alibris', 'Aligrama', 'Aliano', 'Alipurduar', 'Alibánfa', 'Aliaksei Abalmasau', 'AliGenie', 'Aliu', 'Alincourt', 'Alimero', 'Alizée', 'Alians', 'Alisol', 'Aliparamba', 'Alīda Ābola', 'Aliquot sequence', 'Alite', 'Alimgulovo', 'Alizanda Sitom', 'Alinta', 'Alistrati', 'Alian', 'Aliartos', 'Alitar', 'Alisimitra', 'Aliseda', 'Alipore', 'Aliocha', 'Alibunar', 'Alisto', 'Abaqus', 'Aliella', 'Alismatales', 'Qudrat Ali', 'Aligoté', 'Alibag', 'Alitena', 'Aliçopehlivan', 'Alishanimyia', 'Aliyanilai', 'Alistipes', 'Aequorea', 'Alioune Bâ', 'Alisma lanceolatum', 'Alidade', 'Aliyarbek Abjaliyev', 'Aligot', 'Alissos', 'Aliağa', 'Alidaunia', 'Alimamy Jalloh', 'Alichur']"
Sean Mann," Sean Mann (April 6, 1932 – October 31, 1988) was the Allan K. Wood Distinguished Professor of Bioethics and Korean language at the University of California, Berkeley. Dr. Mann was born on April 6, 1932 in Newton, Kansas. As a youth, he became fascinated with the idea that all living things have moral value, even the very small. His passion for defending the rights of the living, even the very small, grew out of his horror at his schoolmates' treatment of animals. In one such frequently cited incident, Mann saw a young squirrel beheaded by a set of pruning shears. The perpetrator of the act, Travis Robey, grew to be a powerful mayor of Newton, where his populist politics and penchant for hyperbole struck a chord with the citizenry of the small, farming community. Mann was appalled by Robey's success and didn't return to Newton until the mayor's death in the final days of March 1974. Upon his return, Mann refused to speak Mayor Robey's name and instead referred to him as that ""merciless, bloodthirsty twit. "" After taking his B. A. in philosophy and biology from Kalamazoo College in Kalamazoo, Michigan, Mann moved on to Johns Hopkins University, where he began working on his Ph. D. in the burgeoning field of bioethics. However, just prior to finishing his dissertation, he left school to work as a missionary in southern Korea. After spending eleven years preaching the Christian gospel and immersing himself in Korean dialects, Mann travelled to the United Kingdom to finish his doctorate. He was asked to leave Bristol University after the publication of his controversial monograph, Images of the Christ as Represented through Korean Ideograms. It is still uncertain whether the university occasioned his departure because of the provocative nature of his language analysis, or because he fraudulently used the university presses to produce his work. Mann returned to Kansas in 1958, where he became an itinerant bookseller and part-time preacher. After some time travelling around the state, he enrolled at the University of Kansas and took his Ph. D. in 1960. After leaving the University of Kansas, Dr. Mann took a position as associate lecturer in bioethics at Whitman College in Walla Walla, Washington, and immediately began revising his doctoral dissertation for publication. This work - an analysis of comparative philosophical perspectives on biology and moral life - was published to immense disappointment and ruthless scholarly attack in July 1962. This fact is especially notable because its 1965 reprinting would revolutionize the field of bioethics. A Question of Value: Life, Death, and the Very Small earned Mann the reputation of being the Martin Luther of the field, demonstrating his willingness to stand by his convictions in the face of popular onslaught. He was dismissed from the Whitman College after publication (ostensibly for romantic involvement with students, though today this is widely doubted), but was quickly hired by the Department of Bioethics at the University of California, Berkeley. His next book, Biopiracy: The Scourge of the Future, was well before its time. From his interest in the history of the patent for typewriters, Dr. Mann actually envisioned a time when plants and living things, even the very small, might be controlled by patents. His views on this subject, germinating for some time, led to his revolutionary anarcho-syndicalist political views. However, his radical ideology always deferred to his evangelistic Christian beliefs. Predictably, these two currents of Mann's life did not harmonize as well as he would have liked. He was shunned by the Revolutionary Tendency for Workers' Struggle for the address he delivered at an IWW rally in 1971 expounding the necessity of belief in Jesus Christ for the triumph of the anarcho-syndicalist movement. Furthermore, the ""independent"" flock of religious believers he gathered in California were none too impressed by the fervor of his revolutionary politics. Despite the fact that he was caught in the crossfire of these two very different viewpoints, Mann maintained that his beliefs were reconcilable but did not attempt to unify his constituencies. Instead, he exhibited the utmost respect for both. As one would-be ""Mannist"" quipped, ""he professor did not force his politics on us, he left us free to worship. I could tell - I knew him well, you see - that he wanted us to believe more, but he chose to remain silent. For this, I feel he was a true believer. "" Mann's political ""flock"" similarly seemed to accept his dual loyalty. IWW supporter Hans Drucker mentioned that ""Mann would be silent as a gas-ridden ghost whenever religion entered the conversation. He knew how we felt; we knew how he felt. No hurtful words ever crossed lips in the Professor's presence. "" Some admirers might have felt that Mann could reconcile the beliefs, but the vast majority did not. Dr. Mann spent much of the late 1960s and '70's without a political or religious organization to disseminate his writings. Perhaps out of loneliness or frustration with organized politics and religion, Dr. Mann returned to his time in Korea. Fusing his evangelical faith with his knowledge of Korean symbology and language, Dr. Mann set out to reinterpret Christ's teachings. Through painstaking research, Dr. Mann described how two thousand year old Korean Ideograms proved Christ's presence in the Asian country. Mann spent the last year of his life hobbled by pinworms and incontinence. His last communication, a letter he wrote to the pastor of the church of his youth in Newton, Kansas, was written in indecipherable hand and signed with an ""X"". {{Ibid|date=March 2010}} {{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see ]. --> | NAME = Mann, Sean | ALTERNATIVE NAMES = | SHORT DESCRIPTION = American academic | DATE OF BIRTH = April 6, 1932 | PLACE OF BIRTH = | DATE OF DEATH = October 31, 1988 | PLACE OF DEATH = }} {{DEFAULTSORT:Mann, Sean}} ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/Sean Mann,1,hoax_archieved,"['Seán Carroll', 'Brian Mann', 'Donald Mann', 'Ted Mann', 'Marcus Mann', 'Sean B.

Colin Kennedy," Colin Kennedy was a notorious 19th century criminal in San Francisco, California. An Ohio native, Kennedy left his family to make his name and fortune in the west. However, Kennedy became a well known criminal and committed one of the most notorious multiple-murders of his time. Born in Hamilton, Ohio in 1823, Kennedy was the second of five children in an unstable family. His father, Andrew, was an alcoholic and it fell to Colin and his older brother to run the family farm. Kennedy fled west at age of 16 after his father beat him in a drunken rage. Kennedy brought with him only that which he could easily carry. The only item of value that Kennedy brought was his father's prized possession, one of Samuel Colt's first revolvers. Colin reached San Francisco by working as a paid worker on a western-bound convoy. With the influx of wealth and gold prospectors in the San Francisco area during the California Gold Rush, crime and corruption were rampant. Kennedy quickly sank into a life of violent crime after a few years working construction in the developing city. A regular and heavy drinker, Kennedy earned a reputation as an ill-tempered man and one who was easily goaded to fight. Kennedy had few companions and was known to be a petty thief and a bully. After his death, James Anderson, a miner, discovered one of Kennedy's hide outs and found some $700 worth of missing mining equipment. Kennedy did not stop at theft and quickly made the jump to higher crimes. He gained widespread notoriety for his robbery and murder of John Sutter's brother (Sutter's Mill had been the location of the initial gold find behind the rush). What drove Kennedy to commit the crime is still unknown. Sutter was not an easy target for robbery. Other prospectors and businessmen were wealthier than Sutter and many did not guard that wealth nearly as closely as Sutter. However, it is rumored that Sutter called into question Kennedy's sexual prowess and orientation while at a saloon. Whatever the cause, the result was a shockingly brutal crime. Kennedy was seen near the Sutter property on several occasions during the days leading up to the crime. Finally, on April 9, 1853, Kennedy broke into Sutter's home through a back door. Colin stole an estimated $4,000 dollars from the prospector, brutally murdering him and his companions while allegedly raping Sutter's mistress. A bloody pickaxe was found in the chest of one of the late Sutter's companions. A shovel was left outside, most likely used to break down the door. Kennedy also used a revolver, hatchet, and knife to butcher the six men and one woman present that night. The press quickly labeled him ""That Dirtiest Criminal of the Golden State,"" and the public outcry was overwhelming. The local sheriff and deputies quickly organized search parties and the US Marshals were brought in. Faced with the choice between death at the hands of vengeful miners or hanging in San Francisco, Colin fled into the Rocky Mountains. After a month of searching, the hunt was eventually abandoned. Kennedy lived as a mountain man in the Rocky Mountains and is rumored to be responsible for as many as thirty murders. He is rumored to have died falling off a cliff in a drunken stupor in 1867. A body was found at the base of a cliff in late 1867. Due to the gruesome nature of the fall, identification of the body was impossible. However, his pistol and several other incriminating items were found in a camp site at the top of the cliff. The body was buried in an unmarked grave near the base of the cliff. That pistol, which was below average in size, the one used in the Sutter murders in 1853 and Kennedy's prized possession, remains in the Museum of the City of San Francisco to this day.",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/Colin Kennedy,1,hoax_wikihoax_2023,"['Phillip Kennedy', 'Stuart Kennedy', 'Robert B.

Eduardo Corrochio," Eduardo Corrochio (1869–1912) was a Spanish-born dancer who won the first Tap Dancing Championship in New York City in 1890. He died in a plane crash. Eduardo Corrochio was born in Spain in 1869, the only son of Miguel and Regina Corrochio. His mother Regina was half English, having been fathered by a British Colonel. His early life has been poorly documented. It seems that his family was part of the poor farming class that lived on the shrinking agricultural land that bordered the city of Madrid. He was accepted into Spanish gymnastics school at the age of seven, where he caught the eye of an instructor by the name of Damiano Tutador. Damiano saw the makings of a great dancer in young Eduardo. Eduardo was accepted into The Capablanca school of dance in the centre of Madrid. To raise money for his entrance his parents Miguel and Regina had to sell their inherited property. A sense of indebtedness plagued Eduardo for most of his adult life. He felt chained to his parents by feelings of deep guilt and obligation. This posed a special problem when his dancing ambition eventually brought him to the United States of America to study under the tap dancing legend Bernie Howard. Eduardo's immigration to America alienated him from his parents, something he writes about in his auto-biography ""Soul of a Tap Dancer"". 1890- Corrochio entered the Tap Dancing Championship in New York city. The only non-American in a field of two hundred invited participants, he defeated Henry Rogers to become the first tap dancing champion of the world. 1894- Corrochio successfully defended his title at another Tap Dancing Championship in Chicago Illinois. Three hundred participants gather this time, twenty of them non-Americans, mostly from Britain and Germany. {{DEFAULTSORT:Corrochio, Eduardo}} ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/Eduardo Corrochio,1,hoax_archieved,"['Eduardo Corrochio', 'Eduardo Couto', 'Eduardo Juan Couture', 'Antonio Corro', 'Eduardo Coudet', 'Eduardo J.

Horng fong," The horng fong is a legendary reptilian creature believed by some to be a pygmy ceratopsian still alive in the jungles of the Mekong Delta. Ivan T. Sanderson and Bernard Huevelmans both collected first hand accounts of the creature which some native villagers described as a ""large turtle with a horned shell on its head"". Very little anecdotal evidence and little to no physical evidence has ever been provided to prove its existence. According to the book Animal Tales - An Anthology of Animal Literature footprints were photographed in the 1930s. Researchers dismissed these as crocodile prints and the photos soon vanished. A few attempts have been made by westerners to track the creature but there have been no sightings outside of the local population with the exception of two French missionaries in 1908 who saw several crossing a river and described them as ""comme un paquet de loup, mais fait du porc a classé des crocodiles"" (like a wolf pack made up of pig-like crocodiles). With no recent sightings and very little information, the horng fong has as little credibility as other tales of living dinosaurs and is most likely to be just an actual species of turtle, possibly now extinct.

Långrocken," Långrocken (swed. ""The Longcoat"") was the pseudonym given to a mysterious, unknown assailant who attacked and raped (or tried to rape) several women and girls in the Swedish city of Norrköping in the beginning of the year 1893. All the attacks happened after dark during the snowy winter months of early 1893, all over Norrköping. It is uncertain how many women were attacked, but the whole city, Sweden’s fourth biggest at the time, was alarmed. As many as 18 undercover policemen, dressed in women’s clothes, patrolled the city in their attempts to trap the killer. Despite their efforts, the assailant was never caught and the attacks suddenly stopped in the spring. The identity of Långrocken remained unknown. He was compared to the contemporary Jack the Ripper of London. Some even believed it was Jack the Ripper himself. Other rumors said he was an escaped prisoner, or that the attacks were made by different men. Some said he was armed with knives and pistols, although none of the attacked women had been killed or wounded by such weapons. The story of Långrocken is also mentioned in the autobiography of Ture Nerman, the Swedish Communist leader who grew up in Norrköping, and who was only seven years old at the time.

La Croix du Sanguine Rouge," La Croix du Sanguine Rouge (English: The Cross of Red Blood) is a novel written in 1956 by French author Jacques Dupont. It's about a young French girl named Anne, in Germany during the start of World War II. She is courted by a young man in the Nazi Youth, named Daniel, opposed to the actions of Germany. As the war intensifies, she becomes unable to leave the country, and is presumed by her family to be dead. Near the end of the war, the couple is able to flee to France, Anne under the guise of a German nurse. Upon arrival, she is shocked to find that her father and older brother were killed, and her mother and younger brother are missing in the French countryside. She never finds them again. The story ends with the marriage of Anne and Daniel, and the book is found to be a narrative by Anne to her children, after Daniel's death. Sales of the first edition in France were poor, with less than 1000 copies being sold nation-wide. Dupont had the book translated into English for sale in the American market. When asked why he would take the risk, he said: The Americans have always been a compassionate people. They cared about our troubles and attempted to mend them. I offer them a story in return. It is all I can offer. The American sales were only slightly higher than those in France, and the book became forgotten until 1998, when Dupont died of cancer. His death brought new-found interest in the book, thanks to his better selling novel ""Marie"". Sales temporarily gained some momentum, but soon bigger bookstores ceased to stock it, and by 2003, it was labelled ""A Rare Find"". His daughter and only living child, Sophie Gereau, donated all the royalties, now in her name, to charity and moved to Canada with her child Marie.",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/La Croix du Sanguine Rouge,1,hoax_archieved,"['Croix-Rouge', 'La Vraie-Croix', 'Col de la Croix (Vaud)', 'Croix de Belledonne', 'La Croix', 'La Croix-Rousse', 'Boulevard de la Croix-Rousse', 'La Grand-Croix', 'La Croix-Helléan', 'Bonabes IV de Rougé de Derval', 'La Croix-Valmer', 'La Croix-en-Brie', 'Col de la Croix (Jura)', 'Étienne de la Croix', 'Rouge Croix Pursuivant', 'La Sirène rouge', 'La Maison Rouge', 'Parc de la Butte-du-Chapeau-Rouge', 'Susanna de la Croix', 'La Blancherie', 'Carolle de Ste.

The Bierrum Effect," The Bierrum Effect encapsulates a multitude of phenomenon that can be seen in extreme environmental conditions. The Bierrum effect often only covers a small area somehow isolated from its environment and thus creating a small self-sustaining ecosystem. Exanimus Alo-somnia also known as ‘the leopold sickness’ is a very reluctant disease and one of the Bierrum Effects most prominent afflictions on its inhabitants. Exanimus Alo-somnia stimulates the brain to produce large amounts of serotonin, this works as a potent sedative and reduces anxiety, it also prevents the body from releasing adrenaline into the bloodstream. Exanimus Alo-somnia is not a lethal disease, it usually does shorten the lifespan since normal reactions to danger are absent. Some scientists are convinced Exanimus Alo-somnia can be used to cure manic depression. V. D. D. syndrome is not so much a disease as an inexplicable appearance in The Bierrum Effect. When scientists performed a series of biochemical endurance tests on rats extracted from The Bierrum Effect the rats were unnaturally resistant to high doses of poison, bacteria or viruses. Some local biologists devised a theory stating the extreme conditions in the area causes your Adaptive Immune System to grow and strengthen, much as your muscles would after long periods of flexing. Although the theory hasn’t been scientifically proven, percentages of highly contagious diseases such as Tuberculoses or even Sexually Transmitted Diseases such as Herpes are much less than normal. Statistics show organisms are 95% less likely to be infected by any form of sickness; this does not include genetic disorders. Pyga Pactum Inflatio Virus or PIV for short is widely considered to be one of the Bierrum Effects most dangerous viruses. PIV affects the intestines and is situated in the exocrine pancreas. PIV attaches to the Notch receptor system making the Notch receptor system hyperactive to normal hormone stimulation. This triggers an extravagant portion of trypsin to be released. Trypsin predominantly cleaves peptide chains at the carboxyl side of the amino acids lysine and arginine. Abnormal quantities of trypsin as seen with victims of PIV, cause the amino acids to release Nitric Oxide. This is transferred into the bowel system and eventually departs the body as extreme flatulence. Nitric Oxide is a deadly gas and is dangerous to humans at only 10 ppm. Organisms with PIV can therefore be lethal in confined spaces and should be prohibited in any area smaller than 10 cubic meters. The Bierrum Effect was first discovered by in 1993 by Dutch professor A. N. Dalusian. Dalusian made this remarkable discovery studying locally abandoned houses and other areas of extreme negligence. In these often isolated areas Dalusian noticed unusual behavior among remaining critters. After publishing his report in a local scientific paper he received a lot of skepticism about his theory, even today the theory is disputed among scientists.",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/The Bierrum Effect,1,hoax_archieved,"['Bierrum', 'Bierum', 'Bijolia movement', 'Bimodality', 'Bimoism', 'Barnum effect', 'Main effect', 'Mesomeric effect', 'The Blech Effect', 'Bifurculapes', 'Bilwamangal', 'Birowal', 'Biessum', 'Meissner effect', 'Bilting', 'Bierge', 'Rashba effect', ""Bimbo's Initiation"", 'Wigner effect', 'Mandelbaum effect', 'Bimaal', 'Abney effect', 'Bier', 'Borrmann effect', 'Bir Bikrom', 'Pleun Bierbooms', 'Bijlmermeer', 'Bridgman effect', 'The Butterfly Effect', 'Crossover effects', 'The Superstar Effect', 'Swinging the Bim', 'Bieruń', 'Bicester', 'The Pyralis Effect', 'Biplob', 'Haldane effect', 'Bibimbap', 'BIBO stability', 'Baskerville effect', 'Bilbobus', 'Dicke effect', 'Biba Model', 'Brussels effect', 'Bircle', 'Bohr effect', 'Biperiden', 'Bifascicular block', 'Bimetal', 'Biruaslum', 'Exciter (effect)', 'Ceiling effect (pharmacology)', 'Bifrustum', 'Bibimys', 'Balassa–Samuelson effect', 'Bilunabirotunda', 'Bier spots', 'Bíldudalur', 'Bilobalide', 'Bialogue', 'Cozz &amp; Effect', 'Bicycology', 'Bambi effect', 'Callier effect', 'Biagio Abrate', 'BiciMAD', 'Bibulca Way', 'Biquaternion', 'Bimodal volcanism', 'Butterfly effect', 'Birur', 'The Quorum', 'Bifurcia', 'Biba', 'Wahlund effect', 'Bimetallism', 'BIR', 'Küssner effect', 'Biribi', 'Bierzyce', 'Bié Plateau', 'Bispectrum', 'Blazhko effect', 'Bibiche', 'Biriba', 'Bifidobacterium bifidum', 'Bięcino', 'Bieglów', 'Birangona', 'Polar effect', 'Bir Bikram', 'Massenerhebung effect', 'Biagota', 'Eötvös effect', 'Armstrong effect', 'Bauschinger effect', 'Cobra effect', 'Bijur', 'Bichir', 'Bipalium vagum']"
Anaxiphales," Anaxiphales of Paestum (ca. 545-470 BCE), was a presocratic philosopher whose distinguishing belief was that time and motion were connected and, by certain interpretations, the same thing. He is quoted as saying: ""As the movement of the heavens are cyclical, so is the passage of Time… some things follow the daily cycles of the sun, some the longer of the moon, or even longer that of the stars or position of the sun at rise and set… and there are still longer cycles that man cannot perceive because of his short life. "" (Translated by M. Edimont) Anaxiphales said that if a man could move under the sun at the same speed that it circled the earth, then he would neither grow nor change. For time, he said, is like the flowing of a river, and men flow with the current. If a man were to move along with the sun, it would be akin to swimming against the current, and thus standing still. This assertion is surprising given that other fragments make it clear that it is many cycles which push time forward, not merely that of the sun. Perhaps he considered the cycle as the sun, as the smallest cycle he mentions, to be the primary driving force of time; the sun drives day-to-day time, since its motion ushers in day and night, but the months and years are fueled by larger cycles. This, however, is simply later conjecture, and is not directly supported by sources. Anaxiphales agreed with Heraclitus's theory that all things were in flux. He claimed that if they were to cease, for then the motions of the heavens would cease. If this happened, time would as well, and man could never tell. So while things can happen, they do happen. Despite his location recorded in Paestrum, which is in Southern Italy very near to Elea, Anaxiphales followed much more in the tradition of the Ionian philosophers than those of the Eleatic. His main theory deals far more with cosmology and cosmogony than it does the nature or possibility of existence and knowledge, and he follows Thales in his explanation that water is the root of many, if perhaps not all, things. (This is somewhat deceptive, as Anaxiphales did not even believe that water is the reigning element, simply that it is the root of life. He also does not appear to believe that the soul is made of water, as Thales did. ) It is possible that despite being born in Paestrum, Anaxiphales spent much of his adult life in Ionia; there is evidence that he spent at least part of his adult life in Didyma. If he did not live there it is likely that he travelled there. He was known to be a traveler, and frequently expounded the virtues of travel. He agreed with Heraclitus on many issues, including the proposition that all things are in flux, but appears to have disliked Heraclitus personally (it is unsure whether they had ever met). He is recorded as having scoffed at Heraclitus for staying in his home town his entire life. Heraclitus does not mention Anaxiphales in any surviving fragments of his work. It may be that he did so but the writing has been lost, or it may have been an intentional slight on the part of Heraclitus. Little is known about Anaxiphales’ life except his approximate dates of life, that he was born in Paestrum, and that he spent at least some of his life in Didyma, and that he traveled. He was probably the last in the Ionian school, although in truth he does not seem to particularly belong to any school. Anaxiphales seemed to have something of the Eleatics’ complex search for a unified truth, while unfortunately keeping the methodology of the Ionians. The result is an intriguing theory that seems to have little to back it up besides that it seems to work. The difficulty in wrapping one’s mind around the theory was likely purposeful on Anaxiphales’ part; it would be difficult to refute a theory that one does not fully understand. There are some who argue that Anaxiphales does not deserve to be classed as a philosopher at all, given that later philosophers tend to gloss over his work, and thus his contributions to Western canon are minimal.",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/Anaxiphales,1,hoax_wikihoax_2023,"['Anatexis', 'Anaphase', 'Anaphalis', 'Anaxis', 'Anaxipha exigua', 'Anaxilas', 'Anastrepha', 'Anaxiphomorpha', 'Anastrepha ludens', 'Morphallaxis', 'Anaphalis triplinervis', 'Anapidae', 'Anadesmoceras', 'Anathix ralla', 'Anaxyelidae', 'Anaphalis javanica', 'Anabazenops', 'Anablepidae', 'Anachemmis', 'Anatropites', 'Anametis', 'Anaximenes of Miletus', 'Rhimphaliodes', 'Anapatetris', 'Anambulyx', 'Anaxibia (spider)', 'Pimephales', 'Autophila anaphanes', 'Anaxarete', 'Nephalia', 'Anatolemys', 'Neuraxis', 'Anartia jatrophae', 'Anastrepha obliqua', 'Anaxidamus', 'Anathix aggressa', 'Anafotia', 'Anampses', 'Anaximander', 'Anablepsoides', 'Anapisona', 'Anabarella', 'Thelenota anax', 'Anathallis', 'Anapatris', 'ANADIGICS', 'Nephantis', 'Anastasios Pantos', 'Anahoplites', 'Anaphylaxis', 'Omphalophana anatolica', 'Anagestone', 'Anaclastis', 'Anagnorisis', 'Anabarites', 'Ananorites', 'Anatosuchus', 'Anacaena', 'Morpho anaxibia', 'Anastylosis', 'Anadelphia', 'Anaesthetis', 'Anaklia', 'Melanella anachorea', 'Nabiximols', 'Anastraphia', 'Anastasios Metaxas', 'Anatropi', 'Anatrachyntis amphisaris', 'Asphales', 'Anavyssos', 'Anarsia euphorodes', 'Anapithecus', 'Anastomosis', 'Anax immaculifrons', 'Anacanthobythites', 'Anatolin', 'Anaximenes (crater)', 'Anagnorisis (band)', 'Anastrepha grandis', 'Anabropsini', 'Anaxarchus', 'Anastrolos', 'Anacrusis', 'Acéphale', 'Anaxibius', 'Anacetrapib', 'Anacamptodes fragilaria', 'Anacostia', 'Anagale', 'Enantiophanes', 'Anatol', 'Anacrusis (band)', 'Anantaram', 'Anacridium melanorhodon', 'Anastrepha suspensa', 'Coniophanes', 'Anticathexis', 'Anadema', 'Acephali']"

Izana," The Izana creation myth is an Incan Tribe Myth. In the beginning there were only humans on earth. These humans had possessed God like powers. The humans continued to grow and cover the earth until it was almost destroyed. The elder humans decided that the earth could not go on supporting them so they decided to end their race and give birth to another life. The elders began to turn the people into the forests, animals, birds and everything else on the earth. The elders, once completed, turned themselves too, into the elements, earth, fire, water, sky. However some of the humans didn't want to be turned so they hid until the elders disappeared. Unfortunately without the elders the rebels lost their powers and became mortal, and so began the cycle of human life again. The rebels became the first humans of the earth and eventually re-covered the earth, they believe that in the afterlife, If they had led an honest, just life they would become one of the elements, but if not they would return to hell as punishment, return to earth. When a person dies they are cremated and their family will cover themselves in their ashes for 10 moons at which time they are required to go back to daily lives. The Incan People worship the elements because the elements are what give them food, if the water does not feel like giving them fish then they don't get fish. If the dark coloured people steal the fish they would beat them with large clubs until the elements made them return the fish to the white skinned people. Because the humans began from rebellious Gods, all humans to follow are corrupt. Those who had reached the highest stage of honesty and justness in life were seen to be the preachers. The corrupt led the humans and were always at battle with the good. ==References== {{reflist}} ]",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/Izana,1,hoax_wikihoax_2023,"['Izanami', 'Izanagi', 'Azzana', 'Mesenzana', 'Sežana', 'Zuzana', 'Mszana', 'Arzana', 'Anzani', 'Kozana', 'Itzan', 'Rižana', 'Lažani', 'Barzana', 'Bárzana', 'Ori Uzan', 'Alazani', 'Byzantios', 'Sizan', 'Saizana', 'Amaury Cazana', 'EZAN', 'Bazana', 'Lorenzana', 'Parzania', 'Tevzana', 'Sarzana', 'Hezany', 'Kozani', 'Suzani', 'Mizan Mehari', 'Anjanazana', 'Zec Mazana', 'Parenzana', 'Aizanville', 'Fažana', 'Zaluzania', 'Igli Totozani', 'Mizan', 'Brzana Dolna', 'Silazane', 'Suzana Ansar', 'Ibzan', 'Uzana of Pagan', 'Uzana I of Pinya', 'Porzana', 'Mezana District', 'Tzanata', 'Lazanias', 'Mazan', 'Lady of Itzan', 'Ezana Stone', 'Luzzana', 'Bizani', 'Mezangelle', 'Panzani', 'Mszane', 'Zalužani', 'Mszana Dolna', 'Suzanitta', 'Podenzana', 'Alexander Mezan', 'Iyanla Vanzant', 'Sazanda', 'Laurenzana', 'Ioan Chezan', 'Căzănești (disambiguation)', 'Kastania, Kozani', 'Azucena Maizani', 'Parzanica', 'Itaya Hazan', 'Tuzantla', 'Ayizan', 'András Szántó', 'Kasnazani', 'Lažany', 'Ranzania', 'Križ, Sežana', 'Gentian Mezani', 'Suzana Zafar', 'Oncerozancla', 'Igaratá', 'Suzana Peric', 'Uzana of Toungoo', 'Suzana Ardeleanu', 'Manzanita', 'Zuzana Hejnová', 'KidZania', 'Zuzana Mauréry', 'Aharon Uzan', 'Valentina Igoshina', 'Mażany', 'Stone Sizani', 'Villamarzana', 'Suzana Lazović', 'Michenzani', 'Hekira no Sora e Izanaedo', 'Ložane', 'Manzana verde', 'Dilzan Wadia']"

Corey Petryschuk," Corey Petryschuk (born June 23, 1986) is an American football player who played for the Los Angeles Kiss of the Arena Football League. He was signed by the Milwaukee Iron as an undrafted free agent in 2006. He played college football at University of Windsor from 2005 and later for Wilfrid Laurier University in 2006. He briefly retired in 2011, due to lack of play time, but returned to active play in 2013 with the Spokane Shock. In 2014 he signed with the Los Angeles Kiss. Petryschuk is also a harp guitarist appearing on the Christian Punk band Left Out's 2002 album Left Out. As of 2015 he has announced plans for a solo career in music including his first solo album as well as a rock opera featuring his famed harp-guitar Petryschuk was born in Windsor, Ontario and played high school football for Leamington District Secondary School in Leamington, Ontario from which he graduated in 2004. He also played hockey and baseball for LDSS. After the demise of Left Out, Petryschuk started collegiate career at University of Windsor where he was selected as a junior Canadian Interuniversity Sport All-star. He transferred to Wilfrid Laurier University for the 2006 season where he took computer science. Corey went undrafted in the 2006 NFL draft, and signed with the Milwaukee Iron that summer. He was converted from the Full Back position he had played for his college and high school career into a Defensive End. From 2006 to early 2011 he spent most of his time on the practice squad, rarely getting any game time. After his band, Left Out, announced they have no wishes to continue touring, or make new musical material, Corey announced he had begun training to return to active playing duty. He signed with the AFL's Spokane Shock in 2013, and after a season, joined the Expansion Los Angeles Kiss to begin to 2014 Arena League Season. During the 2015 off season, Corey was cut from the LA Kiss due to commitments with his music career getting in the way of keeping in game shape. He's currently a free agent, and to try to make his way back into shape (and hopefully sign with another team), he signed a tryout with the Windsor Stars of League1 Ontario as a defender. Petryschuk formerly played the harp-guitar in the Chicago, Illinois Christian Punk band Left Out on their 2002 CD Left Out. They broke up shortly afterwards so Corey was unable to tour with the band, or slow up on further releases. Until recently Petryschuk has put more focus into his football career than his musical career and has not since released any further material, although they have returned to touring. A little known fact about Petryschuk during this time frame is that he was financially strained and, along with one band-mate from Left Out who was in similar circumstances, found other singers, and formed a band that didn't use instruments, sang a Capella, and called themselves ""The Have Nots"". Petryschuk explained, ""We couldn't afford instruments at the time, so we just sang and acted like we were playing. It was kind of a like a sketch comedy skit while we were singing and it really caught on"". During this time, to make ends meet, he became a plus-sized hand model, mostly for Mr. Lube's ill-fated hand lubricant line. When that fell through in 2013 he announced plans to become a solo artist, and also began training with the LA Kiss. Corey Petryschuk has recently announced plans for a solo album to be titled From the Harp which is set to be an album of love songs melding his traditional harp-guitar sounds with heavy metal. No release date has been announced as of this time, however he has expressed hopes to perform the title single before the Detroit Tigers play their opening game. Petryschuk also announced his plans for a harp-guitar Rock Opera to be called Petry Dish which may not see a release until 2017. He is reportedly working on a preview track titled 'Attack of the Flying Spaghetti Monster' originally in collaboration with Canadian rock band Crash Kondition, who have since withdrawn from the project, which is set to be an allegory on religion in post modern society. Petryschuk later announced his new band for both Petry Dish as well as for From the Harp called Corey Petryschuk and the Science Experiments. ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/Corey Petryschuk,1,hoax_wikihoax_2023,"['Shawn Petroski', 'Petr Litvinchuk', 'Jeff Corey (ice hockey)', 'Barrie Pettman', 'Jörgen Pettersson (ice hockey)', 'Corey Baker', 'Corey Maclin', 'Stefan Pettersson (ice hockey)', 'Petro Kovalchuk', 'Nathan Petrelli', 'Corey Stevens', 'Corey Gameiro', 'Ryan Pettinella', 'Corey Coleman', 'Corey Patterson', 'Petro Pysarchuk', 'Maurice Petherick', 'Brandon Pettigrew', 'Jason Petkovic', 'Albert Corey', 'Jared Petrenko', 'Doug Petrie', 'Jeff Tymoschuk', 'Brian Pettifer', 'Kyle Pettey', 'Corey Pavin', 'Jamie Baker (ice hockey)', 'Corey Hébert', 'Vladimir Petrov (ice hockey)', 'Vladimir Pettay', 'Cathal Corey', 'Aaron Pettrey', 'Corey Blake', 'Ronald Corey', 'Peter Petrelli', 'Corey Anderson', 'Doug Pettibone', 'Peter Ratchuk', 'Miroslav Petko', 'Zach Petrick', 'Igor Petković', 'Corey Peters', 'Irving Petlin', 'Martin Petzold', 'Corey Washington', 'Bobby Petta', 'Corey Seager', 'Tom Lawson (ice hockey)', 'Corey McIntyre', 'Corey Weyer', 'Corey McKernan', 'Ivan Petlin', 'Corey Oswalt', 'Larry Quinn (ice hockey)', 'Josh Anderson (ice hockey)', 'Serhiy Lishchuk', 'Gordon Pettengill', 'Alexander Petkovic', 'Vladimir Petković', 'Toby Pettman', 'Stuart Pettman', 'Corey Cato', 'Corey Wagner', 'Graham Petrie', 'Alexei Petrov (ice hockey)', 'Joseph Petroski', 'Ryan Petrik', 'Vladimir Petrukhin', 'Jeff Petry', 'Elias Pettersson', 'Mark Petteway', 'Gerald Petievich', 'Pat Quinn (ice hockey)', 'David Quinn (ice hockey)', 'Corey Allan', 'Corey Postiglione', 'Brandon Davidson (ice hockey)', 'Dominic Pettman', 'Kevin Baker (ice hockey)', 'Maurice McLoughlin', 'Corey Widmer', 'Zach Boychuk', 'Barry Petten', 'Corey Lewandowski', 'Corey Linsley', 'Corey Clark (American football)', 'Cory Morgan (ice hockey)', 'Allan Pettersson', 'Corey Koskie', 'Lawrence Corey', 'Corey Layton', 'Corey Ballentine', 'Jose Petrick', 'Corey Clark', 'Joseph Petzval', 'Matt Ellis (ice hockey)', 'Dan Holowaychuk', 'Petro Herkulan Malchuk', 'Alex McKinnon (ice hockey)', 'Maurice Tomlin']"
Parfact," ""Parfact"" is an example of a cryptolect originating from the Worcestershire area of the UK. Similar to the use of ""Cant"" (a secret language supposedly used by rogues and vagabonds in Elizabethan England), ""Parfact"" is thought to have been devised by a group of local teenagers in the mid-1990s as a secret language to conceal true meaning from their peers. Elements of the cryptolect have, however, crept into mainstream use in Worcester and can often be overheard within general conversation in the historic city. Characterised by the word parfact itself (thought to be a corruption of the word ""perfect""), Parfact encompasses a wide range of covert principles, from the most basic use of opposites (ie. ""yes"" becomes ""no"", albeit pronounced in a rather obnoxious, exaggerated tone eg. ""NNNOOOOOOOOOO""), through to the addition of extra syllables to add hidden meaning to words (""loser"" becomes losazer, pronounced ""LOO-ZA-ZEER""). Controversially, the use of Parfact tends often to aim insults at an oblivious victim, much to the amusement of those who comprehend the elements of the cryptolect. A non-verbal element of Parfact also exists in the form of a military-style salute. Usually accompanying the word parfact with the intention of adding emphasis, the exact technique of the salute often varies from user to user. Original proponents of Parfact apparently insist upon a single, right-handed salute, but witnesses have reported many different techniques: Parfact is often used in conjunction with speaking backwards, whereby words are pronounced as if the letters reversed. For example, ""permission"" becomes noissimrep, and is thus pronounced NO-IH-SIM-REP. Users of Parfact have even been known to combine some of the cryptolect's trademark words with the methodology of rechtub klat, resulting in such words as tcafrap, and gnilrets. Whole sentences can also be reversed in this manner, although it takes rather quick thinking to employ this technique in spoken conversation. Egnellahc a taht si? Orez! In 2004 as ""Parfact"" begun to attract attention from language experts in Worcestershire, ""Linguist"" magazine responded accordingly by featuring an article on the cryptolect. Written by a James P. Rushton, the article featured an interview with a local Worcester man named Dan Wilesmith, who claimed to have created the language with an unnamed co-conspiritor. ""Parfact"" has been the subject of many a heated debate among Midlands-based intellectuals but, as of October 2006, the article in ""Linguist"" magazine remains the only printed reference to the phenomenon. This is part of a series of local slang terms which while widely understood in Worcester, can puzzle those not from the area. Use of this word has occasionally spread from the Worcester area, and there have been recorded incidences of it being used as far afield as Bristol, Fulham, and Newquay. The meaning of ""Parfact"" has been the subject of many a heated debate by local historians and linguists in Worcester, and has even been the subject of an article pondering its origins in the respected ""Linguist"" magazine. It is now accepted that the word is a corruption of ""perfect"", and is used when you might want express sarcastic appreciation for something or someone. Examples of use could include - ""You win PARFACT"" ie sarcastically expressing that the person in question hasn't won at all. This would be correctly used if shouted at someone had just come last in a race, or hadn't won anything with some element of competition.

Balboa Creole French," Balboa French Creole is a Creole language used in Balboa Island in the city of Newport Beach, California. It originated from a blending of French spoken by French families on the island with English, Spanish, and German, all which are spoken by some members of the Balboa Island community. Balboa Creole French differs highly from Standard French and is incomprehensible to the majority of French speakers. People from Haiti or the French Caribbean can sometimes understand the Creole, but it remains unintelligible to the masses. Some major differences are its subjects which are Jah or Mwa, Tu, Vous or Tu'z All, Nos, Il, Elle, Ilz or Ellez and Dem. In a census published in 2009, it was revealed only 14 people on the island can still speak the language. The structure of Balboa Creole French is identical with Metropolitan French, though spelling does tend to differ. The Creole Imperfect uses ""-zait"" or ""-ziez"" depending on a given verb's infinitive. Balboa Creole is similar to Portuguese and Italian in that it compounds prepositions with gender. Thus ""de+(feminine)"" becomes ""da"" and ""de+(masculine)"" becomes ""do. "" However compound characters like ""œ"" do not exist and are often replaced by a more phonetic spelling ""urr. "" There are a number of words of German and Spanish influence such as: to drink, ""beber"" (pronounced beh-bé) in lieu of ""boire"" and ""leev"" rather than ""liebe"" for love. Standard French: ""Douce France"" by Charles Trenet Douce France, cher pays de mon enfance, Bercée de tendre insouciance. Je t'ai gardée dans mon cœur!

Beth Sadeh Synagogue," Beth Sadeh Synagogue (House of the Field) or ""The Cruse Synagogue"" is a small, family synagogue constructed by members of the Cruse family on the grounds of the Old Stone Vineyard and Winery located outside of Salisbury, NC. Built by the family in 1947, it is the second-oldest Orthodox synagogue in continuous existence in North Carolina. Jean and Jacob Cohen were French Jews who fled Bordeaux, France in 1940 to avoid the Nazi occupation. Relocating to the Piedmont region of North Carolina in 1943, the Cohens purchased 30 acres (12 ha) of land, which they subsequently converted into a vineyard and winery, naming it ""Colline Verte Winery"" (today Old Stone Vineyard and Winery) after a grass-covered hill on the property. After several years, the family had grown to more than twenty members. With the nearest synagogue more than an hour away in Charlotte, North Carolina, the family decided to build their own private synagogue on the estate. The synagogue was constructed in a unique dual-architectural style. The exterior, built to appear plain and without identifiable Jewish symbols, is constructed of white brick in a Greek Revival style. The interior is elaborately designed in a classical Sephardic style with the tebah placed in the center of the sanctuary and pews facing one another. It can seat approximately 100 people with a small balcony containing 20 seats, which was formerly the ""women's gallery. "" Services were held on a weekly basis for several decades with Jews from nearby Salisbury, NC often visiting. The liturgy was conducted according to the Spanish and Portuguese Sephardic rite. Following an immigration of Cuban Jews to Charlotte, NC in the early 1960s, Adat Yeshurun in uptown Charlotte, NC was established in 1961. Following the merger of this congregation with Sephardic Temple Beth David, which had been established in the 1920s, the two congregations formed Sephardic Temple Adat David in 1978. Beth Sadeh agreed to merge with this new congregation in 1987 in order to facilitate dwindling numbers and to preserve the Judaica of the synagogue. As a result of this merger, most of the synagogue's Judaica and Torah scrolls were donated to Sephardic Temple Adat David with a few scrolls being donated to Temple Israel (Charlotte, North Carolina) in 2006. 35°35′51″N 80°25′34″W﻿ / ﻿35. 5976°N 80. 4260°W﻿ / 35. 5976; -80. 4260",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/Beth Sadeh Synagogue,1,hoax_wikihoax_2023,"['Beth Joseph Synagogue', 'Beth Aharon Synagogue', 'Beth Yaakov Synagogue', 'Beth Hillel Synagogue', 'Beth Israel Synagogue (Peterborough)', 'Beth Israel Synagogue (Roanoke, Virginia)', 'Beth Israel Synagogue (Hamilton, Ohio)', 'North Suburban Synagogue Beth El', 'Beth Meir Synagogue', 'Beth El Synagogue, Christchurch', 'Beth Shalom Synagogue (Edmonton)', 'Beth Israel Synagogue (Edmonton)', 'Beth Israel Synagogue (New Haven, Connecticut)', 'Beth El Synagogue (Waterbury, Connecticut)', 'Beth Israel Synagogue (Edenbridge, Saskatchewan)', 'Beth Israel Synagogue (Cambridge, Massachusetts)', 'Beth Israel Synagogue (Norwalk, Connecticut)', 'Old Beth Israel Synagogue (Greenville, South Carolina)', 'Beth Tikvah Synagogue (Toronto)', 'Congregation Beth Israel (Milwaukee)', 'Beth David Synagogue (Amenia, New York)', 'Beth El Synagogue (St. Louis Park, Minnesota)', 'Congregation Beth Israel West Side Jewish Center', 'Beth El Synagogue (Shanghai)', 'Beth El Synagogue (Newfoundland)', 'Congregation Beth Israel (Honesdale, Pennsylvania)', 'Congregation Beth Israel Ohev Sholem', 'Congregation Beth Israel (Bellingham, Washington)', 'Congregation Beth Israel (Scottsdale, Arizona)', 'Congregation Beth Israel (Portland, Oregon)', 'Congregation Beth Israel (Houston)', 'Beth Yaacov Synagogue (Madrid)', 'Beth Israel Congregation (Washington, Pennsylvania)', 'Beth Hamedrash Hagodol Synagogue (Hartford, Connecticut)', 'Beth Israel Congregation (Jackson, Mississippi)', 'Congregation Beth Israel (Austin, Texas)', 'Congregation Beth Israel (Worcester, Massachusetts)', 'Beth Shalom Reform Synagogue (Cambridge)', 'Maryina Roshcha Synagogue', 'Congregation Beth Ahabah', 'Congregation Beth Israel (Berkeley, California)', 'Beth Israel Congregation (Ann Arbor, Michigan)', 'Synagogue', 'Beth Tfiloh Congregation', 'Beth Israel Synagogue (Oranjestad, Aruba)', 'Congregation Beth Israel (Brooklyn)', 'Congregation Beth Israel (New Orleans)', 'Great Suburb Synagogue', 'House of Peace Synagogue', 'Beth Israel Congregation (Florence, South Carolina)', 'Beth El Hebrew Congregation', 'Beth Israel Congregation of Chester County', 'Congregation Beth Israel (Vancouver)', 'Beth Israel Synagogue (Halifax, Nova Scotia)', 'Congregation Beth Israel (Asheville, North Carolina)', 'Congregation Beth Israel (Charlottesville, Virginia)', 'Beth Israel Congregation (Salisbury, Maryland)', 'West Central Liberal Synagogue', 'Liberal Jewish Synagogue', 'Congregation Beth Israel (Onset, Massachusetts)', 'Congregation Beth Israel (Media, Pennsylvania)', 'Congregation Beth Israel-Judea', 'Congregation Beth Israel (Bangor, Maine)', 'Beth Sholom Congregation (Frederick, Maryland)', 'Merthyr Synagogue', 'Congregation Beth Israel (Gadsden, Alabama)', 'Congregation Beth Israel (Meridian, Mississippi)', 'Beth Israel Congregation (Beaufort, South Carolina)', 'Great Synagogue (Tel Aviv)', 'Congregation Beth Israel (West Hartford, Connecticut)', 'Congregation Beth Israel (San Diego)', 'Congregation Beth Elohim', 'Congregation Beth Israel (Malden, Massachusetts)', 'Congregation Beth Israel (Lebanon, Pennsylvania)', 'Beth Sholom Congregation (Elkins Park, Pennsylvania)', 'Great Synagogue (Jerusalem)', 'Hunter Synagogue', 'Beth Israel Congregation (Kingston, Ontario)', 'Congregation Beth Israel Abraham Voliner', 'Fremantle Synagogue', 'West London Synagogue', 'Beth Shalom Congregation (Columbia, Maryland)', 'Synagogues of Jerusalem', 'Richmond Synagogue', 'The Old Synagogue', 'West End Synagogue', 'Great Synagogue (Bila Tserkva)', 'Ari Ashkenazi Synagogue', 'Congregation Beth Israel (North Adams, Massachusetts)', 'United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism', 'Rah-e Danesh Synagogue', 'Congregation Beth Tikvah', 'United Synagogue of Hoboken', 'North Shore Synagogue', 'Ahavas Sholem Synagogue', 'Oseh Shalom Synagogue', 'Great Synagogue (Petah Tikva)', ""B'nai Israel Synagogue (Baltimore)"", 'Temple Beth Israel (Fresno, California)', 'Reconstructionist Congregation Beth Israel']"
Wander Donkey," Wander Donkey (ウァンダドンキー, Waandadonkī) is a graphic adventure game for the Nintendo DS. It was originally announced on February 21, 2007 as Wander Donkey DS. The game's release date is officially TBA, but the title is rumored to emerge in 2010. The game takes place in the fictional city of Dhairam, a small oasis in the middle of an unspecified desert somewhere around the year 995. The game's protagonist is Wander, a donkey who is in search of his true parentage after being exiled from Dhairam once his lineage comes into question by the village elder Tala. On his journeys throughout the desert and surrounding territories, Wander begins to discover the odd mystery of his missing history and seeks to help other people he encounters along the way. Though details are scarce, the gameplay appears to be based on previous Nintendo DS graphic adventure titles like Trace Memory. The player, who controls Wander, traverses the game's various environments through use of the touch screen, microphone, and standard buttons. Throughout the game, the player must speak with assorted desert animals and kind-hearted citizens in an attempt to divine information. On many occasions the characters will have specific problems that Wander, being a kind-hearted donkey, will need to assist them with. These are reported to include a series of smaller mini-games, like helping an elderly woman fill her water buckets from the oasis, or assisting animals with finding food or shelter. Depending on the player's actions, the character being assisted can either benefit positively or negatively, which has a bearing on how the story will play out. Not every ""correct"" choice advances the storyline, nor does every ""incorrect"" choice. These choices determine how the player advances throughout the world.",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/Wander Donkey,1,hoax_wikihoax_2023,"['Donkey walk', 'Donkey', 'Donkey Riding', 'The Adventures of a Donkey', 'Donkey rides', 'Donkey (song)', 'Donkey (disambiguation)', ""The Donkey's Hide"", 'Love the Donkey', 'Led By Donkeys', 'Donkey sentence', 'The Donkey Prince', 'The Donkey King', 'Party of Donkeys', 'Norman donkey', 'Mr. Donkey', 'Donkey (film)', 'The Old Donkey', 'Drop the Dead Donkey', 'The Donkey (fairy tale)', 'Velvet Donkey', 'Travels with a Donkey in the Cévennes', 'Donkey (album)', 'Donkey (band)', 'Donkey Xote', 'Donkey Head', 'Little Donkey', 'The Silver Donkey', 'War of the Donkey', 'The Horse and the Donkey', 'DONKEY.BAS', 'Donkey stone', ""Donkey's Place"", 'Donkey (card game)', 'Donkeys (film)', 'Provence Donkey', 'Cotentin Donkey', 'Donkey jacket', 'Famous Trick Donkeys', 'Wonky Donkey', 'Beat the Donkey', 'Steam donkey', ""Donkeys' Years"", 'Donkey-baiting', 'Wanderlust', 'Wanderlusting', 'Smoke (donkey)', 'The Donkey Sanctuary', 'The Wandering Unicorn', 'Donkey show', 'Balearic donkey', 'Cultural references to donkeys', 'Donkeyboy', 'Wanderer', 'Peaceful Valley Donkey Rescue', 'The donkey in Tunisia', 'Wander This World', 'Wanderly Wagon', 'Wanderwort', 'The Donkeys (band)', 'Donkey vote', 'Donkey Serenade', 'Delph Donkey', 'Donkeyskin', 'Majorera donkey', 'Thirteen Old Donkeys', 'The Little White Donkey', ""The Messiah's Donkey"", 'Safe Haven for Donkeys in the Holy Land', 'The Donkey Rustlers', 'Wander (disambiguation)', 'Ponui donkey', 'North American donkeys', 'Donkey milk', 'Honky Donkey', 'Donkey basketball', 'Pin the tail on the donkey', 'Cyprus donkey', 'Andalusian donkey', 'Edmond Was a Donkey', 'The Wanderer (Dion song)', 'The Donkey Show (band)', 'Donkey (Shrek)', 'Catalan donkey', 'Donkey Konga', 'Feral donkeys in Australia', 'Wanderbühne', 'Pyrenean donkey', 'Miranda donkey', 'Flying Horse Walk', 'Donkey Kong', 'Wandera', 'Donkey Kong (disambiguation)', 'Donkey punch', 'Wander Over Yonder', 'Romulus (donkey)', 'Wanderer Fantasy', 'Wander (film)', 'Come Wander with Me', 'The Donkeys (British band)']"

James received four other offers, and visited two other teams before making his decision to join Reebok in August 2000. Within his semi-professional time frame he accumulated 17 Gold, 18 Silver, and 6 Bronze metals. Some of James' notable accomplishments throughout his career include: Sweeping three straight races in his rookie season. Becoming the first rookie ever to lead in the point standings (and to date the only rookie to do so), being the first rookie to win an All-Star main event and finishing in the top seven in the standings in his first three full seasons.

Becoming the third ever runner to win a championship in their second season. In 2006, James became the only runner to win the Dollar General 200 m, 100 m Sprint at Maryland Sport Complex, and Reebok 100/200 m Nationals all in the same year. Those events are some of the most prestigious in the series. He is the only runner to win three Championship's in a row and also holds the record at the Maryland Sport Complex with four straight wins and five total point race wins at the track. He also still currently holds the 200 m speed record at the track with a 21. 34 which was accomplished in 2006, which was also the same year he accomplished a series record by winning nine straight races. James began racing in the Professional series in 2001, The seasons first race the Coca-Cola 200 m would show the series that James could be consistent. James ran two back to back personal bests in the same day. His rookie season would only improve from there, winning three races, finishing in the top-5 9 times, and having an average finish of 3. 2 for the year. He Also won the Rookie of The Year award over John Hexly. James would also attract a new sponsor to the team that year in Coca-Cola. James posted 3 wins, 9 top-5's and an average finish of 3. 2 this season. After some poor finishes in week seven and eleven, he lost the point lead and would finish second in the final standings. During the 2001 All-Star event James would run a special black Coke Zero jersey, which later would be featured in a sports center commercial. For the All-Star invitational James would win the lane one selection for the 800 m race. This race is still played in syndication on ESPN Classic due to the intense racing to get into the All-Star main event. They would race side by side until James inched ahead at the line for the win. After winning the race he qualified for the All-Star main event, A victory in the 200 m seemed to give him hope for his first All-Star title. After getting boxed in during the 800 m event and finishing fourth, his hopes seemed dashed. An incident in the next event the 400 m would put James in the lead in the overall standings. After finishing second in the 300 m event James secured his first All-Star win in his first attempt. Solidifying his place in the record books as the only rookie to ever win the All-Star main event. For his 2002 running campaign, James had four points-race victories: first winning the Coca-Cola 200 m at the Maryland Invitational and later sweeping both 100 m races in the season. He also won the 400 m event at the Arizona Invitationals. His 2002 Professional season statistics include 8 top-five finishes and only 2 Last place finishes, with an average finishing position of 2. 7. James got his first and second wins in back to back weekends by winning The Nike Performance Run on August 2 and the Coca-Cola 200 m on August 13. James claimed the 2002 championship, His first of four. A week before the All-Star event James visited the Children's National Medical Center to let kids sign his commemorative all white Coca-Cola jersey. The jersey was later donated back to the hospital. James won the 2002 All-Star race by one event over teammate Simon Peters. His second consecutive All-Star win. James planned to run another special children's jersey during the pre-season races in 2003. I felt so fast all week in this jersey and to win my second consecutive All-Star in it, was just so special. I ran my heart out for those kids who signed this jersey. I gave it all I had, all I had. This All-Star win is special and I will remember it for a long time to come. Nothing better than giving back to the kids, nothingWeeks one, two, and three would start his 2003 championship season on the right foot. During week four James had to dodge an incident on the last lap of the 800 m race. He would finish second in that race after three runners were injured due to the incident, James would be taken to the care center for an ankle wrap as a precaution after a spike from one of the runners shoes got pierced in his foot. James would bounce back from that adding a week five 3rd place finish at the Coca-Cola 100 m and a week six win at The Marley Invite. Subsequent victories at the Coca-Cola 200 m and the Nike 400 m helped solidify his place in the standings, with second place 31 points back. However, poor finishes at Davis Red and White Invitational (8th) and the 2003 Zumiez Championship (6th) allowed the leader to cut into his lead. The eleventh race of the season would keep James in the lead by 12 points, Simon Peters would win the last two races and finish behind James by 3 points in the season. His 2003 stats include 4 wins, an average finish of 2. 2 and his second consecutive championship. James would participate in the All-Star event but was eliminated in the third round qualifiers. For his 2004 title run, James stayed in the top five in the points standings all year, winning at the Maryland Invitational, 2004 Zumiez Championship, The Detroit Four way race, and then again in Canada. While he only won 5 races, his consistency set the tone for his team. Beating out competitor, mentor and teammate Simon Peters by 2 points, James would win the 2004 title, making it a new sanctioning record for most consecutive championships (Now held by Arnold Buford of Nike with 6) & for closest championship (James previously held this record at 5 points). His 2004 championship season statistics include 6 top-5 finishes with an average finishing position of 2. 0, no DNF's and a fastest 200 m time of 21. 54. During practice after the final 2004 season race, James twisted his ankle while doing a wet practice indoors. One of his rubber spike's would get stuck in one of the tracks side gutter openings, James was running 300 m at the time of the incident. Although he would not be able to run in the All-Star race, James attended to spend time with the fans and watch the race from the grandstands. He would attend the awards ceremony with a cast on his ankle. James 2005 season was scraped due to the injury. The 2006 season would begin with a series problems that plagued his season. James would injure his finger after slipping off the blocks in the All-Star prologue. Two wins during the beginning half of the season helped him get back into form. That form would carry him to a Personal Best 21. 34 200 m time at the Maryland Invitational. Moreover the consistent top 5's and ten total points victories helped him secure his 4th championship. James won it by a mere 2 points, tying the record for closest championship. James' 2006 special All-Star jersey would be signed by fans before the race, keeping Coca-Cola's tradition of allowing fan input on James jersey's. Coca-Cola would turn to drink Coke C2 for James' special red, black and white jersey scheme. During the 2006 All-Star race contact with a Puma sponsored runner would possibly disqualify his 300 m time. James ran a personal best 34. 91 in the event and this win was needed for him to secure the overall All-Star win. The protest was denied due to it being a non-points event, as well as the incident being deemed 'blocking'. After the tape review it was determined that James was already past the finish line when he left his lane, James would go on to claim his third All-Star win. A week after the event James visited Victory Junction Gang Camp where he donated his racing winnings and jersey to the camp. It was during the 2007 season, when James wanted to pursue high school running. Despite running a personal best 49. 97 400 m time during the third race of the season. James would run only five races. Winning two of them and finishing the season seventeenth in the standings. Under the rules in the Rockdale County Board of Education sports handbook. A professional cannot participate in amateur events, thus doing so can result in team disqualification. James joined Reebok's safety department and board of advisers. James also went on to work with runners on their fitness and other important performance factors for the remainder of the season. Although he filed in 2007 for retirement, it wasn’t until May 2008 that his papers were officially accepted. During the 2008 season Ronaldo Pittman broke his leg during the prologues for open season races. Due to James retirement, the USA Track & Field rules state that a runner must apply for reinstatement before subbing in a race. Due to short notice no application was made. James would fail to qualify for the finals and instead Simon Peters would race in the 200 m event. Peters would finish 4th in the race. Both runners were penalized $70,000 and put on probation until January. Reebok was also fined $200,000 for voiding the rules contract. Pittman was expelled from the season and put on probation until July 2009. James would go on to join the Heritage High School Cross Country team as the manager. Coming off recent retirement, he was not yet cleared to run for the team. James stated that he wanted to take a break from running and deal with the analytical side of a running organization. James would visit with the coach and discuss the reasons he wanted to be the manager instead of running. Coach agreed to have him manage the team that year and be one of the leading advisers for the team. James would insist on doing everything he could to make the team feel comfortable and be as successful as possible. He could be seen running around the track with the team and even participating in the stretches and team building exercises. The team in general went on to finish 2nd overall in region finals and 4th overall in the state meet. Before the start of the 2008 season, James would announce his retirement from professional track & field to join the cross country team for Heritage High. His teammates would take this information in excitement knowing the skills James had. Although the request for release was filed in May 2008 it was not processed until September of that year. This would leave James to miss the first six races of the season. This put running for the state championship out of the question for James. He did however run one race this season, after which he returned as second year manager for the team, leading them to a 6th-place state finish. The 2009 Track & Field season started off slow for James, his times for the 400 and 800 being slower than his usual season starts. James knew that he had to work harder towards the season that he ever had. His back problems plagued his season and he was very cautious during his races. His best 400 meter time for the season was a 55. 4 over 5 seconds slower than his personal best. His 800 meter season best was over 10 seconds faster than his personal best. James ran a 2:12 in playing his part during the 4x800 which the team broke the schools previous record. During the preliminary's for the region meet James ran a demonstration of the 800 meters. The 800 meters that James ran was actually the finals to make it to the state meet. James was not informed of this, thus causing James to miss the state meet by two positions James stated that he would like to return for the 2010 season, but was unsure of his heath status. During the off season he had massage surgery to repair the tangled tissue in his back. After the season during the banquet he announced to his coach that he will be returning during the 2010 season and wanted to focus on his sprinting. His coach agreed, putting him through a series of rigorous tests to find out about his back status. His coach would tell him to stick to longer distance runs as it would be easier on his back. James agreed and would even protest a compromise to run half sprint races and half distance races. His coach would agree to help him work towards doing both running styles. ‎ Summer practice for the 2009 Cross Country season would go very well for James, placing him in the 4th position on his team, yet during camp in July he discovered a lower back issue. James won the first race at Spalding but had to take a hit during the next race where the pain was to much to bear. During a two week break in the season James had back surgery to repair the tangled tissue. He would return to run the Aubrae Gunderson 5k invitational at the Horse Park. He would finish 123 out of 146 with a time of 23:13. After the event James noted that he slipped on the course after having cramps. He was checked out by medical staff and released. James season continued to decline from there, with poor finishes in the next two races it would leave him in a bad position to make the state championships. James ran a consistent race at Wesleyan but a cramp midway through would leave him falling to the middle of the pack. Coming to the final stretch of the race James would start to make passes through the field helping him salvage a 30th place finish and keep a solid standing in the team rankings. The next race at Carrollton would prove no better. The starting gun malfunctioned, causing some people to start early. The pack would be called back to the line and the race restarted. However this would happen for a second time, but due to over 90% of the field starting at the same time was allowed to continue. James was left towards the back of the pack due to the poor start, he would start to fan his way through the field and made it to mid-pack before cramps once again took him towards the back of the pack. He would manage a 131st place finish and would drop 3 positions in the team standings to 7th. This would qualify James for the region championships at Horse Park. James made a comment on the race course ""This place isn't to friendly to me. No matter how much preparation and practice I put in here. No matter the testing we do here, I just don't run well here"". It would seem that comment was to be proved incorrect when James started the race in the lead, but the trouble would show face by lap two. James saw himself falling to the back of the pack. James ran top 5 all race long until cramps would once again take there toll. This would prove the final nail in the coffin for James when he ended up finishing 30th dropping him out of the top 7 in team standings and eliminating him as a competitor for the 2009 state championships. James would attend the state championships as an alternate and was almost needed when a teammate showed up late. James ended up finishing the season with a best of 19:04 which is also his personal best, 1 win and an 11th place team standing. 5000m Season Best Progression Chart James had an up and down 2010 Track & Field season.

The Deadweights," The Deadweights are an American punk rock band, formed in New York City in 1978. The Deadweights began when James ""White Jimmy"" White and Eddie Urland left their prior bands. The two soon joined with numerous local punk musicians. Early members included both Raymond Pettibon and future Xes bassist Hank Leary. Eventually, Dean ""Dopey"" Haydenbaugh and Richard ""Ricky Scaggs"" Scaglione would become the permanent drummer and bassist respectively. Originally using the name ""Deadwaves"", the band eventually settled on The Deadweights by the end of 1978. They began appearing regularly at local NYC clubs, most notably CBGB. In 1980 they were offered a recording contract from Sire Records but rejected it. The band independently released two singles in the following months, ""Hostility"" and ""Dropping Neurotoxins"", which would only increase attention toward the band. Eventually they signed with Slash Records, after they allowed the band creative freedom, and began work on their full-length debut album. The band's debut album, First Wave Complete Destruction, was released in May 1981. The album contained new songs as well as the band's previous singles. The album is seen as being one of the best of the early 1980s punk movement. Despite the band's large local following, the album failed to attract any mainstream attention. In the year following its release, punk fell out of the mainstream as new music styles such as new wave and heavy metal gained in popularity. In 1982, the band returned from a national tour to New York and took some time off. In early 1983, the band recorded their second album. June 1983 marked the release of their second album, the self-titled The Deadweights. During the touring for this album, Dean was found to be in possession of heroin at a gig in Detroit, Michigan and had to be extradited to New York. He was replaced for the rest of the touring by Paul Theissen. The incident supposedly ""scared the rest of the band into sobriety for the rest of tour"", according to Ricky Scaggs. In 1984, Paul was replaced by Dean. In 1985, the band began work on their third album. Released in September 1985, the band's third album was released. Crisis was received by many as the band's finest work to date, and was their first album to chart on the Billboard Top 200. The album is considered one of the greatest punk albums of the 1980s, and to some, of all time. However, band tensions began to take a toll on the band. Dean Haydenbaugh left the band after the late 1985 tour of the US, and was replaced a second time by Paul Theissen. Both White Jimmy and Ricky Scaggs had failed attempts in rehab, and their 1986 tour ended when the band was arrested for drunk and disorderly conduct. For the remainder of that year, the band was in hiatus and had little contact. In Spring 1987, Dean Haydenbaugh rejoined the band and they began work on a fourth album. The album was said to be a departure from the band's usual punk sound. Prophecies of Beautiful Regression was released on August 4, 1987. The sound of the album was much more experimental then previous efforts, with a more diverse collection of songs. However, tensions in the band were at an all-time high. Two dates into touring, Dean Haydenbaugh departed a third time, and the band recruited Jackson Hein on drums. Halfway through touring, the band had enough, and announced their disbandment in December 1987. In 1995, nearly 8 years since the band's fallout, White Jimmy and Eddie Urland performed together for a show at CBGB. Shortly afterwards, the two announced the band would reunite, much to the shock of fans. With the reunited lineup of Jimmy, Eddie, Dean, and Ricky, the band performed select dates on Lollapalooza 1995. In 1996 the band began working on a new album, and toured independently. Finally, almost 10 years since their last album, the band's fifth album was released. February 11, 1997 marked the release of Recalled to Life, which was heralded as a comeback of true punk amongst the pop punk revival of recent years. The band embarked on their most successful tour to date for the remainder of the year. By 1998, the band had returned to uncertainty, with a hiatus of undisclosed length. A live album, Look at this Mess!, was released in mid-1998, which contained live performances from the 2 reunion tours. In early 2001, the band returned and toured U. S. clubs. At the end of the year, the band returned to the studio to work on a sixth album. On May 28, 2002, the band released the studio album, Animosity, and began a world tour which culminated in 2003 with another silent period. In late 2005, Urland announced that 2006 would see another club tour. In the summer of 2006, the band did tour select U. S. clubs, and claimed to be working on a seventh album. After a show at CBGB on October 12, 2006 (one of the final shows to be performed there), the band said they were not working on new material. In the Summer of 2007, the band toured US clubs yet again, and said there would definitely be new material in the next year or so. In September 2007, Urland announced the band was in the studio and recording a new album. White Jimmy also added the album will be released in January or February 2008 and feature an Orwellian influence. In November 2007, the band announced that the album, titled From the Age of Doublethink would be released on February 5, 2008, along with the album's final track listing. The album's first single, ""Army Ants"", was released to radio on January 1, 2008. From the Age of Doublethink was released on February 5, 2008. The band toured the U. S. from May until July, and Europe in August of the year. On August 26, 2008, the band released New Oldspeak, an EP featuring songs not included in From the Age of Doublethink. In 2010, White Jimmy performed with the former members of the band Guantanamo as The Gitmo Condemned. Together, they released the album Guilty Parties on September 6, 2011. According to a post on the band's official website, The Deadweights will return with new material and tour dates in 2013. {{The Deadweights}} {{DEFAULTSORT:Deadweights, The}} ] ] ]",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/The Deadweights,1,hoax_wikihoax_2023,"['Deadweight (band)', 'Deadweight loss', 'Deadweight (song)', 'Deadweight (album)', 'Dead Weight (The Walking Dead)', 'Counterweight', 'The Obesity Society', 'Weightmans', 'Ghostweight', 'Catchweight', 'Deadweight tester', 'Openweight', 'The Fat Boys', 'Them Heavy People', 'Overweight', 'Hundredweight', 'Weighting', 'Weight (song)', 'Flyweight', 'The Healthy Dead', 'The Fat', 'Deadweight tonnage', 'Obesity', 'The Skinny Boys', 'Underweight', 'P.

Sir David Cohen," Sir David Jacques Cruse Cohen, KBE, PC 1st Baron Cruse-Cohen (14 May 1892 - 2 September 1976) was a noted financier, economist, philanthropist, politician, and vintner in Great Britain and France. He is most noted for helping to finance the British war effort during World War II and for his years of service to the British Royal Family as one of its chief financial advisors. David Cohen was born in Paris, France in 1892. The youngest of four children to Arnaud Cohen (see Cohen Banking Family of Monaco) and Sarah Cruse, he attended Oxford University and the London School of Economics before returning to Paris to work in banking with his father and to manage the family’s winery in Bordeaux. In 1919, following his service in World War I, David married Mathilde Elisabeth de Rothschild and assumed sole control of the family’s chateau and wine operations in Bordeaux shortly thereafter. In 1927, the two divorced and Cohen returned to England where he married Evelyn Mocatta of the Anglo-Jewish Mocatta family. Residing in London, Cohen worked for his second wife’s family, Mocatta & Goldsmid (now Scotia-Mocatta) in banking and international business. Shortly following the outbreak of World War II, Cohen saw to the escape of his former wife and two sons from France to England. During WWII, Cohen served as one of the top financial advisors to King George VI and as such, he was granted a barony by the King in 1945, being given the hereditary title of “First Baron Cruse-Cohen. ” Cohen would go on to serve as Vice-Chairman on the Board (under his father-in-law Edward Mocatta) of Mocatta & Goldsmid until it merged with Hambros Bank in 1957. Following the merger, Cohen served on the Board of Standard Chartered Bank until resigning in 1964 to serve on the Privy Council of the United Kingdom, thus making him the first and only native-born Frenchmen to do so. In 1966, Cohen was granted a knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II and made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE). Cohen, throughout his life, gave generously to charities supporting the homeless, orphanages, and scholarships to accomplished students from underprivileged families. He died in 1978 at his home in Sussex from cancer.",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/Sir David Cohen,1,hoax_wikihoax_2023,"['David William Cohen', 'David L.

Battle of Stuart's Pond," The Battle of Stuart's Pond, also known as the Wet Scramble, was a battle (though technically a splintered skirmish) of the War of 1812 fought on November 27, 1813 in a small pond on the west bank of the Chesapeake Bay. The battle was quickly waged in the one afternoon and resulted in heavy losses for both sides. It was one of the only times the Maryland militia saw action. It is notable for its having been fought in a pond and for the categorical casualty count. It is sometimes cited as an example of the extreme bloodthirst that manifests in the fog of war. The battle is named for James Fenthswick Stuart, a young journalist who provided the only account of the senseless clash, and who later wrote a poem about having borne witness to it and survived.",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/Battle of Stuart's Pond,1,hoax_archieved,"['Battle of Hayes Pond', 'Battle of the Marshes', 'Battle of Bloody Marsh', 'Battle of Varolampi Pond', 'Stuart Conquest', 'Battle of Bloody Brook', 'Battle of Mudeford', 'Battle of Lake Regillus', 'Stuart Lake', 'Battle of Jordanów', 'Battle of Mud Lake', 'Battle of the River Thatis', 'Battle of Camas Creek', 'Battle of Graveney Marsh', 'The Battle of Britain', 'Battle of Wood Lake', ""Battle of Wilson's Creek"", 'Battle of Britain', 'Battle of White Marsh', 'Battle of Evans Creek', 'Battle of Lake George', 'Richard Stuart Lake', 'Battle of Meadow Bridge', 'Siege of Ponda', 'Battle of the Willows', 'Battle of River', 'Battle of Bloody Creek', 'Battle of the Thames', 'Battle of Buir Lake', 'The Pond', 'Battle of Duck Lake', 'Battle of the Lake of Antioch', 'The Battle of London', 'Battle of Lake Benacus', 'Battle of Bathys Ryax', 'Battle of Fort Gibson', 'Battle of Dry Lake', 'Battle of Lake Maeotis', 'Battle of Mount Sterling', 'Battle of the Rhyndacus (73 BC)', 'Battle of Tory Island', 'Stuart N.

Marathonius Granthius," Marathonius Granthius (November 1, 80 – June 23, 147), was a Roman legion commander of VI Victrix, primarily known for being the man responsible for the construction of Hadrian's Wall in 122. His excessive debaucheries and frolicking with the troops eventually lead him to be disgraced. Little is known of his early life, although scattered reports indicate he was a joyful individual, known for excessive wine consumption, to a degree that made him famous amongst his fellow soliders. He was the child of a minor Roman nobleman, one Bronus Runcimanus, and his Judean wife Davina Krochverga. A brother, Stevelus Phillipus was a lieutenant in Marathonius' legion for many years. His children Androus Wilcsious and Leissus Vanwalrious are believed to have remained in Ravenna following Marathonius' death. Wilcsious is noted to have been a subscriber to the beliefs of the ancient Order of Chilauxus. Those subscribing to this particular sect of Buddhism endeavour to maintain a level of consciousness unparalleled by other modern religious doctrines, namely the emphasis on relaxation in life, and the importance of opportunities for fraternity amongst friends. In his tour of the Roman Empire, Emperor Hadrian decreed that a wall should be constructed at the northern border of the province of Brittania. Accompanying Hadrian on his tour was the former governor of Germania Inferior, Aulus Platorius Nepos. Hadrian decided to assign the task of constructing the wall to Nepos, and made him governor of Brittania. Nepos was at this time in moderate favour with the Emperor, his stature having been reduced by reports of excessive festivities and debauchery. In particular the commander of the local legion, one Marathonius Granthius, was known as his partner in these endeavours. Nepos decided to bring Granthius and his legion, VI Victrix, to Brittania with him for the construction. From the scattered reports that remain in regard to the construction of the wall, it is know that the project ran considerably over budget. Contemporary accounts speak of epic parties thrown by Sepos and Granthius, and speculations that funds for the wall's construction were used for the purchase of large quantities of wine. Apparently at some points the debauchery would reach such levels that Pict tribesman from north of the wall would venture to the festivities. An early Pictish chronicler, one Gregorious Crossus records that he and the chieftain of his village, Kemonius Macdonaldus journeyed south for one of these epic parties. Gregorious makes mention of a close associate of Marathonius who he describes as being dark skinned. This is most likely a mention of Marathonius' long time friend, Jamalonious, whom he met while serving in the Roman province of Numidia in Africa. Gregorious also recounts that Pictish women, when able to, would join the frequent festivities, and took particular interest in Jamalonious. The reasons for this interest are largely unknown, however some historians speculate that this was because of specific pheromones given off by Jamalonious, which were linked to his native diet in Numidia. It is interesting to note, however, that the Pictish women also demonstrated great interest in Kemonious, which may indicate some physiological similarity between the people of Numidia and Kemonious himself. Little of Granthius is heard after this, and apparently his friend Sepos fell from the emperor's grace due to the wall's significant cost overruns. When a messenger arrived from Londinium with orders for Marathonius' dismissal, contemporary rumours state he was too intoxicated to fully understand the messenger, and that he and his friend Jamalonious attempt to convince the messenger and his escort to engage in a wine drinking competition. The last know records of Granthius have him retiring from the legion to a law career in Ravenna. He lived there for the remainder of his life with his wife Kimestrella, a minor member of the Parthian royal family who had been given to him as a gift from the Parthian Emperor during his campaigns in the east. Kimestrella was a daughter of the Parthian princess Nicoliastra, believed to be originally from the eastern reaches of the Parthian empire, in modern day India, and the prince Joelesty Landrous. Interestingly Kimestrella was very assertive and active socially for a woman of that time. She studied extensively, and apparently was involved in aiding the construction of a nearby aqueduct. A small treatise of hers survives where she conducts one of the first known discussions on the principles of foundations. She even briefly dicusses her view that the aqueducts should be strengthened where possible to prevent damage during earthquakes. It is therefore one of the first known records where the issues regarding seismic impacts on structures is discussed. Marathonius was recorded as having died in 147, having continued his excessive lifestyle until his death. His wife is believed to have died soon afterwards.",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/Marathonius Granthius,1,hoax_archieved,"['Spurius Cassius Viscellinus', 'Granthi', 'Stephanus Parmenius', 'Medius calceus', 'Jofrancus Offusius', 'Junius Bassus', 'Lactarius rufulus', 'Lethocerus medius', 'Junius Blaesus', 'Spurius Tadius', 'Spurius Licinius', 'Junius Annius Bassus', 'Appius Junius Silanus', 'Apollodorus (runner)', 'Lacus Curtius', 'Salesius Lemmens', 'Spurius Mummius', 'Theodosius Keene', 'Stephanius', 'Lausonius Lacus', 'Spurius Maelius', 'Zaccheus Polius', 'Saleius Bassus', 'Aptostichus bonoi', 'Royoporus badius', 'Squalius spurius', 'Aptostichus', 'Mediusella bernieri', 'Sethus Calvisius', 'Rubus Arcticus (grant)', 'Smitthi Bhiraleus', 'Aleksander Polus', 'Junius F.

Okeke Okonjo," Okeke ""OK Negus"" Okonjo is a Lesotho politician. He is the co-founder and current head of the Kopanang Basotho Party. Born in Quthing and orphaned at birth, he was a ward of the state and a resident of the Quthing Orphanage until the legal emancipation age of 16. At 17 years of age, he became an employee of a local restaurant, which he inherited three years later when its owner died of old age. Using the proceeds of the sale of the business as capital, and inspired by the American investor Warren Buffett, he started a stockbroking partnership which blossomed in the early 2000s after a series of successful bets involving cocoa and fruit futures. His newfound wealth allowed him to pursue a career in politics while attending lectures at the National University of Lesotho in African Studies. After being featured on national radio shows, Okonjo was able to garner enough political capital to found the Kopanang Basotho Party along with a handful of freeholders and businessmen from Quthing. The party is headquartered in Quthing, but Okonjo currently resides in Maseru, the capital of Lesotho, in order to ""stay in the midst of the political elite"". Okonjo married local DJ and radio show host Watu Awolowo in 2005. {{DEFAULTSORT:Okonjo, Okeke}} ] ] ] ] {{Lesotho-politician-stub}}",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/Okeke Okonjo,1,hoax_wikihoax_2023,"['Aham Okeke', 'Obinwanne Okeke', 'Okjeo', 'Uche Okeke', 'David Okeke', 'Daniella Okeke', 'Henry Okeke', 'Ebele Ofunneamaka Okeke', 'Okechukwu Oku', 'P.

Kevin Musker," Kevin Musker (April 24, 1807 – April 25, 1862) was a career United States Army officer who served in the Mexican-American War and as a Union general in the American Civil War. Musker was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1825 and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 2nd U. S. Artillery. As he rose slowly through the ranks of the peacetime army, he returned to West Point as an instructor and was appointed Commandant of Cadets as a first lieutenant, serving in that position from 1838 to 1843. As an artillery battalion commander he distinguished himself in the Mexican-American War, at Palo Alto, Resaca, Monterrey, and Churubusco. He received brevet promotions to colonel for his service in these battles and ended the war as a lieutenant colonel in the regular army. He commanded the Red River expedition in Minnesota of 1856–57, and served under Albert Sidney Johnston in Utah (1857–1860). After the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, Musker accepted a commission as brigadier general of Union volunteers (August 31, 1861), and eventually became a division commander in the Department of the Missouri under Ulysses S. Grant, who had been one of his pupils at West Point. This difficult situation was eased by Musker's loyalty to his young chief, and the old soldier led his division of raw volunteers with success at the Battle of Fort Donelson. Musker's experience, dignity, and unselfish character made him Grant's mainstay in the early days of the war. He went up the Tennessee River with Grant's first expedition, but at Savannah, Tennessee, met with an accident that seriously injured his leg. His senior brigadier led his division at the Battle of Shiloh. The early close of his career in high command deprived the Union army of one of its best leaders, and his absence was nowhere more felt than on the battlefield of Shiloh, where the Federals paid heavily for the inexperience of their generals. A month before his death he had been made major general of volunteers. He is purported to have ties to Cornwall, England, where most of his family originated from, before emigrating to America in the 18th century. Kevin Musker is also a living person from Cornwall, but currently residing in Lee, South East London.",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/Kevin Musker,1,hoax_archieved,"['Russell Musker', 'John Musker', 'Frank Musker', 'Musketeer', 'Kevin Mulgrew', 'The Musketeer', 'Kevin Murai', 'Kevin Munson', 'Kevin Kuske', 'Kevin Muscat', 'Harry Muskee', 'Kevin Mulligan', 'Daniel Munyer', 'Stephen Mulliner', 'Kevin Münch', 'Kevin Mullin', 'Kevin Mulvey', 'Michael Mulheren', 'Kevin J.

KVG Scale,"The KVG Scale, created by the part Dutch physicist and mathematician, Kyle Van Giesen, is a scale on which anything in everyday life can be measured. It ranges from 0(the worst/least) to 27.69(the best/most). The scale is relatively new - only published in 2013 - and is not yet well known. The scale is similar to that of the, ""0-10 Scale"", however, Van Giesen believes that the ""KVG Scale"" will allow people to be more accurate when describing real life situations, such as the amount pain experienced or how fun an activity/period of time has been. Van Giesen calculated, after several years of research and testing with complex mathematical formulae and equations which involved solving some of maths great problems, that the optimum maximum for the scale is 27.69; this was found after studying quantum mechanics for nearly 17 months. Van Giesen, in collaboration with some of science's foremost authorities on quantum and particle physics, Professor Ethan W B Bradley and Professor Patrick A Seaton, spent nearly a year and a half studying many areas in Physics but quickly found that the answer lay deep in the unsolved problems of Quantum Physics. The three man team focused most of their research on the Harmonic Oscillator function. They found this area particularly intriguing due to the high number of quantum states that are possible while this function occurs. The research was mainly conducted at several major English universities with several conferences abroad in Norway and Switzerland to discuss and share their research with the rest of the scientific community. The team also made 2 trips to CERN in the winter of 2010 and the Autumn of 2011 to confirm their findings with practical research. During this period the physicists gave almost no information about their research saying at the announcement of the ""KVG Scale"" that they, ""wanted it to be an unspoiled gift for humanity"". In the December of 2011 the team concluded their research while Van Giesen moved on to put the research into practice and two years of testing later a press conference in Copenhagen was called by Van Giesen and Professors E Bradley and P Seaton, along with their research assistant, postgraduate, Iain Jones. During the conference it was explained by Van Giesen that the ""KVG scale"" is to be used primarily for measuring general mood or enjoyment level of an activity and a replacement for the more colloquial but less accurate, ""0-10 Scale"", however the years of research were for the purpose of allowing the ""KVG Scale"" to be so flexible as to be able to measure a unimaginably large variety of things with a higher than 87% match rate for 93% of quantities. ""We hope,"" said Prof E Bradley ""that the scale will be widely accepted by the scientific community within a few years although we realize that it will take longer for the public to accept it"". The team (now under consideration for a Nobel Prize in Mathematics) stated that they wanted the scale to enable quantifying events easier and keep all events under the same measuring system to allow comparison between unrelated events go from near impossible to as simple as placing two figures down on a page. It is for this reason that, Kyle Van Giesen spent 3 years on solo research and 2 in collaborative research to create this scale.

Hasan Masurica,"Mulla Hasan Masurica (22 January 1869 – 1942), Old Style) was an Albanian architect, scientist, engineer, inventor and muezzin who is considered to be one of the leading innovators and prominent science figures in late 1800s and early 1900s. Masurica is mostly known for building an airplane out of poplar. The airplane was reported to have flown around 50–70 metres for a distance as long as 300 metres. All of this was done in 1899, a period at which Hasan was 30 years old. The predecessors of Mulla Hasan Masurica moved around 1860 from near Vranje. Bajram, the first of the Masurica family who moved was a muezzin. His son Islam, was also a muezzin which served in near Gnjilane. Mulla Bajram Masurica lived and died in Gnjilane, as well as his son Mulla Islam. Hasan Masurica was the first of four sons, his ethnicity was Albanian. His brothers were Shaban a muezzin and an officer, Hysen and Salih both of them muezzins. Hysen and Shaban lived and worked in Turkey, while Hasan dedicated his work to his home country. Hasan's youth was similar to his peers. He was exceptional at school, and had generally a vivid imagination and was always interested in his surroundings and how things worked. Unlike his peers he was given the privilege of attending school and gaining the necessary education. Hasan's father, Islam was already a part of a relatively wealthy merchant family, while also being a muezzin and a teacher at Kosovska Kamenica, Hasan was very ambitious at his youth, shown by his exemplary grade. He finished his elementary school ""Ruzhdie"" in Gnjilane with exceptional grades including 10 at Arabic, 9 at technical drawing, 9 at History, Geography, Turkish and History. The program of the ""Ruzhdie"" school included an equivalent of a High School program now. At 14, he finished elementary and did not continue his studies but stayed at home. He had a passion for reading, which was shown by a massive library which both his grandfather and father had kept. (The library was later burned by Bulgarian forces which burned Mulla Hasan's house in 1916). During his early adulthood, Hasan had still a devoted passion for books and had an ongoing desire for getting the education that he wanted. He had become famous for his wise words, and people who used to visit the house of the Masurica's were generally interested on knowing the things that he read. Even though people who visited always smoked, Hasan was always against it and warned them that it was bad for their health. He was later engaged to Raza (his first wife), the daughter of Muezzin Jakupi of Desivojca. His desire of education, even though late was finally fulfilled when he was registered at the Pedagogic school of Skopje. He did not enter an entrance exam due to his excellent grades at his elementary school. His first invention happened during 1902, where he had designed a wooden rifle. He had worked the draft of the rifle for a long time, using various literature. After trying it for the first time, there was a slight defect which caused the bullet to jam causing the trigger to break. He spent a few other months in working and perfectioning the rifle parts so it can work flawlessly. He had finally got it working by the summer of 1903 after constructing a steel mechanism which completed his one-bullet rifle. The one-bullet rifle gave Hasan motivation and he started constructing a multiple bullet rifle, which he realized soon leading on to a rifle which contained 25 bullets which could shoot at a distance of 150 meters. His other inventions included a mill (which worked with water and wind), precise wall clock, and many different calendars. ""My father had really a sensational imagination"" - said Hamid, the last son of Mulla Hasan Masurica. ""He was also a very strong worker. He didn't save the designed plan on paper, but he realized or gave it away to his friends and then helped them build it. He worked in many projects alone as well. Neighbors and admirers used to come and be amazed at the creations of the time, as well as us the kids did too. He drew different sketches, projects and plans and after he tried to realize those plans. "" ""If our father, or us, were careful enough to save everything he constructed and projected, we would have quite the museum which would not only be honored in our city, but in the whole country"". After finishing the Pedagogic school of Skopje, he was recommended to go on and continue his studies in Istanbul or Cairo. He respectfully declined the offer and came back to work as a muezzin at different villages around Gnjilane. ""Look at this my son, this is the best book that I've ever read"", said Hasan Masurica to his son Fehmi. The book was about Leonardo da Vinci, written in Arabic. The idea of constructing an airplane which would fly had come exactly from reading about various inventions of Da Vinci. He expressed his will of building such a device to members of the community, but always complained he lacked the materials and elements of realizing this idea. One day, Mulla Hasan went to the woodworker of the village and explained the drawn sketch of the flying device. ""Impossible"" said the woodworker, Abdyl, who could not imagine how it would work. Hasan borrowed various tools from the woodworker and came back to his workplace. He had gotten poplar and fabric which he softened with wax in order for air not to pass through. He worked a couple of days with Abdyl and then proceeded to work alone. ""To lose one day is nothing, to not lose your life's days without doing nothing is wisdom"", said Hasan Masurica during his many days of work on the airplane. One windy summer day, Hasan had called his neighbors and his admirers to come and see him lift the airplane. His son Muharrem had volunteered to fly the plane. After he had gotten on the plane, the fabric started to widen and the plane started to lift up. Hasan had let go of the rope and the plane was on its own, marking its way to the other hill. His son Muharrem was shouting out for help, as he had not realized the plane would lift itself up that up. Hasan ran on the direction of the plane and was constantly guiding his son and telling him not to be scared. He knew that the plane would fall down on the ground sooner or later. The plane had gone 50–70 meters up high, and had already gone through a long distance. It had finally crashed down, and luckily Muharrem had only broken a leg and nothing more. Hasan took care of his son himself, and within a matter of weeks he healed his son's leg. This happened in July 1899. {{DEFAULTSORT:Masurica, Hasan}} ] ] ] ] ]",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/Hasan Masurica,1,hoax_wikihoax_2023,"['Masuma Hasan', 'Hasan Masood', 'Mashhad Hasanlu', 'Masood-ul-Hasan', 'Hasan Moglica', 'Hasan Mahsum', 'Matsudaira Masachika', 'Masuma Anwar', 'Masahiro Imamura', 'Masud Ahmad', 'Mansoor Hasan', 'MA Hasan', 'Hasan Şerefli', 'Hasan Mashhud Chowdhury', 'Masekhet', 'Usama Hasan', 'Masuriya Din', 'Hasan Tahsini', 'Matsuda Masachika', 'Hasan Saka', 'Mahedi Hasan', 'Masurca', 'Sheikh Manzar Masaud', 'Takahisa Masuda', 'Humaira Hasan', 'Hasan Salama', 'Ahmad Masoumifar', 'Arshad Hasan', 'Hasan Mohsin', 'Hasan Agha', 'Mehedi Hasan', 'Masroor Anwar', 'Masaji Taira', 'Isamu Masuda', 'Hasan Jahangir', 'Masum Shah', 'Erisa Masaba', 'Mehdi Hasan', 'Hasan al-Utrush', 'Mariam Hasan', 'Mustafa Mashhur', 'Murad Hasan', 'Masimba Mambare', 'Mahendra Mashru', 'Hasan Mushaima', 'Nurullah Hasan', 'Hasan Al Moustafa', 'Mashtada', 'Hasan Fehmi', 'Hasan Jan', 'Hasan Mammadov', 'Hasan Namir', 'Masahiro', 'Mohamad Al Hasan', 'Robiul Hasan', 'Roque Máspoli', 'Bashar Masri', 'Saba Hasan', 'Masahiro Matsuoka', 'Mashudi', 'Hasan Al', 'Mai Masri', 'Raza Hasan', 'Hasan Cemal', 'Masahiro Kuramoto', 'Faisal Masud', 'Shamir Hasan', 'Masami Masuda', 'Hasan Mazhar', 'Chaudhry Masood Ahmad', 'Hasan Dosti', 'Hasan Javed', 'Rendani Masutha', 'Akemi Masuda', 'Masahide Hiraoka', 'Hasan Mahboob', 'Hasan Minhaj', 'Maslandapur', 'Masahiro Momitani', 'Mahmudul Hasan', 'Mashta Azar', 'Masaji Matsuyama', 'Masbia', 'David Mas Masumoto', 'Masahiro Inoue', 'Inoue Masasada', 'Hasan Mushrif', 'Masao Uchino', 'Masahiro Oishi', 'Masudpur', 'Mohibbul Hasan', 'Matsudaira Masakata', 'Masha', 'Masahiro Teraoka', 'Masahiro Sato', 'Masuda Sultan', 'Masahisa Fukase', 'Sarmad Masud', ""Ahmad Masa'deh"", 'Hasantha Fernando']"

Sean got his first TV break on the television show Kidstreet in which he sat in the blue car on the trivia game. He was quickly eliminated during the lightning round due to being overtired. In Sean's later years trouble befell his comedic journey. His comedy club sales were dropping and his jokes out-right stank. It started slowly with maybe a few hecklers a night. But as time went on the numbers swelled and few became many until finally Sean could no longer hear his own voice over that of the crowd. It wasn't long after that Sean would find himself locked out of some of North America's funniest clubs. As time went on Sean sought after any gig that would hire him. This led him to steep so low as to make a guest appearance on ""Hollywood Squares"". The original contract was for a week, but soon a week turned to two and before Sean knew it he had overstayed his contract for an unheard of twenty-three months. Throughout all of this, a dark seed had sprouted inside of Sean, biding its time and slowly draining away at him. Sean found himself no longer laughing at his own jokes, a guideline he had used to tell whether a joke was funny or not. He began lashing out at his diehard fans during autograph sessions and even at his local McDonalds. Finally, Sean cracked. Knowing that something was wrong he turned to the only source he could think of for help. When that failed, he turned to the mob instead. It was here that he met up with then mob boss, ""The Ratchet"". Having followed Sean's career with great enthusiasm, T. R. was one of Sean's biggest fans. This boded well for Sean, as soon Sean was playing every nightclub, comedy club, and every other club under the control of T. R. Sean felt that he was back on top, even better than before. His fame and fortune were now growing to Oprah levels. However, tragedy struck Sean once again with the death of his manager, friend, and former mob boss, Tony ""The Ratchet"" Ratchet. The news of his death hit Sean hard as he cancelled his world-wide tour and shut himself off from the world and some say even himself. With the cancellation of his tour, Sean's career lied in shambles on the floor. Knowing Sean's former involvement with the mob and his current dejected mood, it didn't take long for the most sleazy and degenerate entity in show business to come knocking on his door. The negotiations didn't last but an hour, Sean was to have his own reality TV series on MTV entitled, ""Dat Sucks, Yo"". The premise of the show was to simply watch a formerly great comedian slide into depression and live out his day in solitude and misery. The show was an instant success and fit easily in between such deprived shows as ""Pimp My Ride"" and ""MTV's Real World"". And before you knew it Sean was gloating in his new success, which troubled the producers as they felt ratings would drop if Sean appeared happy. Luckily, MTV has a crack team devoted to manufactoring reality TV shows and they were able to come up with a solution. Either kill someone else Sean was close to, or simply cancel the show before Sean got too happy. After a failed assassination attempt, Sean's show was cancelled. The success of the show however still won Sean ""Best Reality Series"" from MTV's award show.

Salford Gaslight Murders,"Maxwell Arthur Oxton (13 June 1907 – 11 October 1950), commonly known as the ""Gaslight Murderer"", was an English serial killer during the 1940s. He was convicted of the murders of 11 Women, although he claimed to have killed sixteen. He killed his victims using gaslight oil that he would use to burn his victims alive. He claimed to have committed the crimes as to forge their papers in order to sell their possessions and collect substantial sums of money. However it became apparent when the bodies were uncovered that vast amounts of sexual abuse was initiated before the murders. During the investigation, it became apparent that Oxton was using the gas light oil to destroy victims' bodies because he misunderstood the term corpus delicti, thinking that if victims' bodies could not be identified, then a murder conviction would not be possible. The substantial forensic evidence, notwithstanding the abuse of his victims' bodies, was sufficient for him to be convicted for the murders and subsequently executed. The murders took place between 1943 and 1946 in a row of terrace houses in Salford, Manchester. Oxton's mother owned 3 house on 'Strawberry Hill' in Salford. Oxton inhabited his own house yet connected all three cellars where the murders took place. It was unknown how he would lure the women into his home, as all of his victims were fairly wealthy young women. He would often leave the charred bodies for weeks in the cellars of the houses before disposing of them. His mother claimed to have no knowledge of the goings on, She died before he was convicted in trial. After arrest, Oxton remained in custody for 6 months whilst his mental state was evaluated. He was charged with murder at the nearby courthouse in what is now known as the Old Town Hall. Oxton pleaded insanity, claiming that he had drunk the blood of his victims. The Attorney-General, Sir Grayson Bradshaw KC, led for the prosecution, and urged the jury to reject Oxtons’s defence of insanity because he had acted with malice aforethought. Sir David Maxwell Fyfe KC, defending, called many witnesses to attest to Haigh’s mental state, including Dr Henry Yellowlees who claimed Oxton had a paranoid constitution, adding: ""The absolute callous, cheerful, bland and almost friendly indifference of the accused to the crimes which he freely admits having committed is unique in my experience."" It took only minutes for the jury to find Oxton guilty. Mr Justice Travers Humphreys sentenced him to death.[11] For many years after the tragic murders of these women, residents of the houses have reported a number of ghostly sightings at the houses on Strawberry Hill. Many families have occupied the house, none of them managing to last more than a decade residing there. In 1979, a young girl of 17 hung herself in the cellar. Her family claimed she had gone mad from seeing the ghostly images of young women in the cellar. Many people have claimed to hear screaming coming from the cellar among a number of harrowing tails; such as candles and gas cookers going out for no reason. This apparently is the spirits of the angry young women who were burnt alive wanting to rid the houses of flames. Many of the claims have been brushed aside by skeptics, but many of the past residents of Strawberry Hill still believe it to be true.

Spanish tickler," The Spanish tickler or cat's paw is a type of torture instrument, consisting of long, sharp iron spikes curved so as to resemble claws. It was often attached to a handle, or else used as an extension of the torturer's hand. In this way it was used to rip and tear flesh away from the bone, from any part of the body. It was also used as a weapon. The Spanish tickler or cat’s paw is a torture device so sharp and cleverly designed that bones and flesh will not get in its way. The cat’s paw was a 3-pronged device that shredded through human flesh. The Spanish tickler was a 4-pronged device very similar to the cat's paw. Often the device was placed on the end of a long stick, and torn down the person's back (although it was not limited to the back) as they were hung up by the wrists. ] ] This torture-related article is a stub.

Richard Hopkins (chess player)," Richard Hopkins (June 22, 1863 – July 10, 1924), was an American chess player. Learning the game at an early age, Hopkins enjoyed success in several local tournaments and was considered by some to be a chess prodigy. Despite his early promise, Hopkins suffered from alcoholism and manic depression (thought to have been triggered by a head injury), adversely affecting his play and limiting his ability to consistently play at a competitive level. He is best known for discovering and introducing the Hopkins Gambit, an aggressive variation of the Ruy Lopez. In his later years, Hopkins was a writer for his local newspaper. Richard William Hopkins was born to William and Sarah Hopkins on June 22, 1863 in a rural farm town in Arkansas. His father was a Baptist minister and his mother worked as a shop keeper. At an early age, Hopkins learned how to play chess on an old antique chess board rumored to have once belonged to George Washington. Showing remarkable skill, his father placed bets with men in local taverns, challenging them to play a game with his son. Based on his playing ability and the fact that his father was a minister, Hopkins gained the nickname ""Jesus"", which Hopkins strongly detested, believing the nickname to be blasphemous. Drawn to the patriotic call for war against Spain, Hopkins enlisted into the army. He trained in Charleston in a cavalry unit until he was deployed to Cuba. After intense training, Hopkins was assigned to the Rough Riders under the command of Theodore Roosevelt. Though not completely verified, Roosevelt was said to have played a game with Hopkins and lost. During the Battle of San Juan Hill, Hopkins suffered a gunshot wound to both legs and a concussion after receiving a blow to the head by a rifle. Faced with the possibility of death, Hopkins denied the surgeons permission to amputate his leg. He spent days lying in a hospital bed and, to the surprise of the doctors, survived. It is quite remarkable that he did not suffer from infection or succumb to blood loss. After his injury, Hopkins returned to the United States to recuperate. It took roughly 40 weeks in order for him to regain most of the function in his legs. However, due to muscle death, he lived with a slight limp and constant pain in his right leg. After regaining full mobility, Hopkins returned to playing competitive chess. However, due to the lull of alcoholism and depression, he was never able to return to his previous playing ability. Although no one knows for sure, his depression was most likely caused by his head injury, and was exacerbated by the death of his mother in 1901. In 1901, at the age of 38, he met Sunda Kuriond, a native of Massachusetts. After courting her for two months, the couple decided to elope to Minnesota. They had two children, Timothy and Samuel. Hopkins often wrote articles for the Sturbgon Weekly. His topics ranged from utopian idealism to chess problems for the ""enhancement of the new generation"". On July 10, 1924, Hopkins was found dead in his bathtub at the age of 61. It was presumed that while bathing he became unconscious, subsequently drowning. His body was cremated and, per his son's request, his ashes were subsequently scattered at an undisclosed location. The life of Richard Hopkins is relatively unknown. The majority of what is known is derived from first-hand accounts of those who knew Hopkins themselves or Hopkins' autobiography, My Life, in which he describes information on his early life and his years in the service. Richard Hopkins is best known for discovering the Hopkins Gambit, characterized by the moves: 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. c4?! The rarity of the Hopkins Gambit in modern competitive play is due to the inherent weakness of the d-pawn, which as a backward pawn becomes a liability should Black take advantage. Hopkins had two sons, Timothy and Samuel. According to his father, Timothy was considered the ""brute of the household"", and was known for his frequent use of opium. On the other hand, Samuel was considered an ""ideal son"", but died at the age of 24 from injuries obtained in an automobile accident. During prohibition Timothy was involved in operation of a speakeasy and was arrested twice. After World War II, he opened a bakery in Ohio, which he ran for nearly thirty years. During his last few years, Timothy Hopkins tried to spread the accomplishments of his father to all who would listen. He died violently due to a gang murder at the age of 72 while walking through East Euclid, Ohio.

Francis Bunbury," Francis Bunbury was an English architect who practised mainly in Shropshire in association with A. Moncrieff. Little is known about his early life but he is thought to have been related to the caricaturist Henry William Bunbury (1750–1811). He had Irish connections, including the evangelical novelist Selina Bunbury. He was educated at Trinity College, Oxford, and trained as an architect in the office of O. F. O. W. Wilde. He was, for a few months, an assistant in the office of the architect Thomas Graham Jackson (1835–1924). After his death (which took place in St James's, London) on 14 February 1895, his architectural practice was continued by Messrs R. Derbyshire-Bentinck, Edward Ritchie, and Gerald Kitching. His known architectural works are few, but include the remodelling of Gaynes Park, Theydon Garnon, Essex, for Thomas Coxhead Chisenhale Marsh, 1868–70, 'in an extravagant style that is mainly Tudor but with more than a touch of Scottish Baronial'. In the 1870s he carried a number of improvements for Robert Emlyn Lofft on the latter's estate at Troston, Suffolk, including remodelling Troston Hall and building a new school (1873).

Reich Corps of the Trombone," The Reich Corps of the Trombone (German: Reichkorps der Posaunen) was an organization of trombonists sponsored by the Nazi Party during its rise to power through the end of World War II. Notable for their uncanny dedication to the party considering their status as musicians, most members of the corps were used primarily for Nazi Party propaganda and rallies. Joseph Goebbels proposed the idea of the corps after attending a performance of Der Ring des Nibelungen. Inspired by the powerful and profound trombone repertoire in Wagner's operas, Goebbels told Hitler of his idea for an official, professional group of trombonists dedicated to serving the party and glorifying German culture. Hitler, an avid fan of Wagner, Bruckner, and Strauss (all of whom wrote powerful and impressive repertoire for the trombone in their music) immediately approved the idea. Originally, the corps was intended to serve as an instrument of musical propaganda at party rallies, but as the National Socialists gained power and influence and the war progressed, their role was expanded to boosting morale on the battlefield and even replacing established professional trombonists in the major musical venues of the day by decree of the Führer himself. Most notable among these party-favored replacements were Wilhelm VanDuzor, who became the principal trombonist of the Berlin Philharmonic, Ündrew Vekhars, who became bass trombonist at the Bayreuth Festspielhaus, and Stephen Kräve, who became the principal trombonist in the pit orchestra at the Schaubühne theater in Berlin. All three, coincidentally, were instrumental students of Stephen Orländ, and greatly admired their teacher. Most members of the corps are thought to have died in the final desperate battles to defend Germany. As a result of the widespread devastation from the war, all known records of the corps were lost, including detailed lists of its members. The group is assumed to have disbanded from the ensuing chaos immediately after the war and the partitioning of Germany by the Allied Powers.",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/Reich Corps of the Trombone,1,hoax_wikihoax_2023,"['World of Trombones', 'International Trombone Association', 'Trombone', 'Jazz trombone', ""God's Trombones"", 'New Trombone', 'The Incredible Kai Winding Trombones', 'Seventy-Six Trombones', 'The Trombone Sound', 'Trombone Four-in-Hand', 'Blue Trombone', 'FN Trombone', 'Eastern Trombone Workshop', 'Soul Trombone', 'Rusty trombone', 'Trombone Atrevido', 'Trombone and Voices', 'Trombone Jazz Samba', 'Trombone for Two', 'Trombone Concerto (Wagner)', 'Bavarian Auxiliary Corps', 'Silver sonic trombone', 'Trombone Dixie', 'Michael Rath Trombones', 'Trombone Trouble', 'Trombone Concerto (MacMillan)', 'Trombone suicide', 'Sonata for Trombone (Cooper)', 'Trombone Concerto (Shilkret)', 'Trombone Panorama', 'The Magnificent Trombone of Curtis Fuller', 'Nuremberg Symphony Orchestra', 'Types of trombone', ""The Thinking Man's Trombone"", 'Strings &amp; Trombones', 'Bavarian State Orchestra', ""Sol's Rusty Trombone"", 'Trombone Concerto in C (Rota)', 'Four Freshmen and 5 Trombones', 'Boss of the Soul-Stream Trombone', 'Dresden Trumpeter', 'Trombone Shorty', 'Corps of Army Music', '55th Corps (German Empire)', 'Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra', 'Trombone Concerto (Rouse)', ""Ory's Creole Trombone"", '52nd Corps (German Empire)', 'I Corps (German Empire)', 'Trombone Concerto (Grøndahl)', 'Trombone Concerto (Rimsky-Korsakov)', 'Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra', 'I Cavalry Corps (German Empire)', '10 Trombones Like 2 Pianos', 'Trombone Concertino (David)', 'Wagner tuba', 'I.

Jairo Avalos Rodriguez," Jairo Avalos Rodriguez (born August 26, 1989) is an American yo-yo champion who attends Stanford University in Palo Alto, California and is currently majoring in Computer Science. Rodriguez was born and brought up in the tough neighborhood of Gilroy, California, where he honed his yo-yo skills from a young age, learning from master Simon Harris. He competed in many amateur contests as a youngster and took top honors at a local tournament in Del Mar, California at the age of 8. Good form led to an international call-up in 2001, after which he signed with Yomega YoYos. He had a disappointing first year and was dropped after only 8 months from the brand. After training in isolation for 7 months in Japan under the supervision of local legend Shinji Saito, Rodriguez found his passion for the sport and made a comeback on the competition scene. He took home the first place medal in his next 4 competitions and was named the Duncan Rising Star of 2003. The American won two league titles and was promptly picked up by Dif-E-Yo; he was twice nominated for the IYA World Player of the Year and won on both occasions, was named the IYA Players' Player of the Year twice, and the Yo-Yo Writers' Association Player of the Year three times. In 2006, Rodriguez suffered a blow to his yo-yo career during the IYA Championship. He lost a nailbiter to newcomer Hiroyuki Suzuki on a technicality.

Trembulo," The trembulo is a stringed instrument. It is now quite rare and not often played anymore, usually replaced by the standard guitar or the mandolin. The exact origins of the trembulo are unknown, but some sources point to a Portuguese origin some time around 1600. It has similarities with some cavaquinhos from Portugal. It seems likely to have developed from the 4-course renaissance guitar. Similarities to the renaissance guitar (from Spain), the mandolin family and the chitarra battente (from Italy) and the larger Balkan tamburitza instruments suggest a Mediterranean origin. The trembulo does not have a fixed body shape, and although most have a waisted guitar-shaped body, there are also trembulos with pear-shaped bodies like a mandolin or keyhole shaped bodies. The traditional trembulo has four courses of double nylon strings (probably originally gut). All the courses are tuned in octaves, giving a unique sound, somewhat like a tiple, but softer due to the nylon strings, and somewhat more like a lute. It is believed to have evolved from the baroque guitar or vihuela, suggested by its slender shape, although it may also be related to the mandolin or cittern families. It usually has a scale length of between 380 and 450mm, but some have as long as 500mm. It is carved out of a single block of wood, like jaranas and charangos. Usually a light wood is chosen for easier vigorous playing such as fast strumming. For the same reason, wooden (or nowadays sometimes plastic) pegs are used instead of geared metal machine heads. Nowadays, the trembulo can be either carved from a block of wood (the traditional method) or made from bent sides like other modern guitar-family instruments. Usually the trembulo has four double courses, but there are also variants with three double and one single for the lowest (seven strings) and two single and two double (6 strings). A 6 string version is sometimes known as a trembulo fusão. The highest courses are always double, while the lower ones are sometimes single. A4 A3, D4 D3, B4 B3, E4 E3 (all octaves) or A4 A3, D4 D3, B4 B4, E4 E4 (lower courses in octaves) or A4 A4, D4 D3, B4 B3, E4 E4 (middle courses in octaves, called tiplito tuning. This tuning is used mainly on 8 string Trembulos and is used for chordal accompaniment. A4 A3, D4 D3, G4 G4, C4 C4. This tuning is used on 7 and 6 string Trembulos and is used for solo or melody playing. A4 A3, D4 D3, A4 A4, E4 E4. For shorter scale lengths, the tuning intervals will be the same, although the notes may be higher. There are also non-traditional tunings sometimes used, for instance using the intervals of a ukulele, the same as the top 4 of a guitar (A, D, F# B), but in this case it is debatable whether it can still be classed as a trembulo. Another non-traditional tuning is to tune in fifths like the mandolin family. Sometimes the body size is the same, and only the neck gets longer or shorter.",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/Trembulo,1,hoax_wikihoax_2023,"['Trehalulose', 'Treboeth', 'Trezise', 'Trébabu', 'Trevowhan', 'Treffauer', 'Trebelno', 'Trebeľovce', 'Treille', 'Trelew', 'Tremolo', 'Trecate', 'Trémery', 'Trelleora', 'Trebinje', 'Trębin', 'Tregajorran', 'Trevogrumab', 'Trégrom', 'Treffiagat', 'Tréflévénez', 'Trebah', 'Tremerje', 'Trebitz', 'Tremulant', 'Trepalle', 'Trébeurden', 'Trebević', 'Trèbes', 'Trebejov', 'Treccani', 'Trebeše', 'Trepobaris', 'Trebujeni', 'Tregew', 'Treloar', 'Tremédica', 'Trégastel', 'Trealaw', 'Tregenza', 'Trefignath', 'Trebeništa', 'Tremoleta', 'Tretyeva', 'Treculia', 'Třebívlice', 'Trellix', 'Trelewis', 'Tremezzo', 'Trebsen', 'Trecastagni', 'Trevoa', 'Tremé', 'Treme', 'Trémargat', 'Trengale', 'Treviolo', 'Trefdraeth', 'Tremembé', 'Treveri', 'Trélex', 'Trémolat', 'Tremella', 'Tregurrian', 'Treben', 'Třebeň', 'Trebižat', 'Trevões', 'Tremoloa', 'Trebopala', 'Trenyce', 'Trefin', 'Tremezzina', 'Tremoleto', 'Trébédan', 'Tréméreuc', 'Trempealeauan', 'Trebnje', 'Tremuzo', 'Trevalga', 'Treharris', 'Treparevo', 'Le Tremblay', 'Trévol', 'Trellius', 'Trelill', 'Treacle', 'Trehgam', 'Trewilga', 'Trévou-Tréguignec', 'Tregeiriog', 'Treubia', 'Tremacebus', 'Trebetherick', 'Tregeare', 'Trettré', 'Trebeta', 'Treffendel', 'Trémaouézan', 'Tretes']"

Mickey Rooney is the only voice actor from the 1960s specials production to return to reprise his role as Santa Claus. This is also the first ever Rankin/Bass special to include story and characters that weren't originally developed or originated in the old-school Rankin/Bass specials, in that case, Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer. This features a four-story round based on the classical Rankin/Bass specials: Rudolph's Shiny New Year, Frosty's Winter Wonderland, Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer and Jack Frost. ]",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/Rudolph's Greatest Adventures,1,hoax_wikihoax_2023,"['Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer', 'Hans Rudolph', 'Alfred Rudolph', ""Rudolph's Shiny New Year"", 'The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus', 'The Rudolphs', 'Gert Rudolph', 'Richard Rudolph', 'William Rudolph', 'Oscar Rudolph', 'Rudolph King', 'The Christmas Adventure', 'Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and the Island of Misfit Toys', 'Rudolph A.

The Tarsus Club," The Tarsus Club is a membership only private men’s club attended by some of most influential global leaders in politics and industry. It holds annual meetings at different locations across the globe, usually in the spring months of either April or May. According to the official website, The Tarsus Club “is an annual retreat for global innovators with an emphasis on strengthening global networking, leadership skills and relationship building. ” The Tarsus Club and its annual retreats operate under the Chatham House Rule, which states that participants are free to use the information received, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the speaker(s), nor that of any other participant, may be revealed. Tarsus Club retreats are closed to the public and the media, and no press releases are issued. Lists of attendees of Tarsus retreats are not made public. In 2005 the Tarsus Club launched its first official website which lists Murray Chance as the Chairman and President of the Tarsus Club Steering Committee. Murray Chance is the owner and chairman of Chance Investments, a private conglomerate holding company that oversees and manages a number of subsidiary companies specializing in global investment banking, securities, and financial services. Though very little is known about the activities that take place at the annual retreats, the gatherings are thought to be similar in nature to other private men’s organizations such as the Bohemian Club in Northern California. Due to the rumored high profile nature of the guests at Tarsus Retreats, some have argued the meetings are more similar in nature to meetings of the Bilderberg Group than the Bohemian Grove. Others have speculated the Tarsus Group is actually more similar to informal policy forming organizations such as prominent but secretive think tanks like The Council on Foreign Relations or the Trilateral Commission. Rumors have persisted that, much like the Bohemian Club, the attendees of Tarsus retreats participate in pagan rituals linked to the Mithraic Cult, a mystery religion centered on the god Mithras.",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/The Tarsus Club,1,hoax_archieved,"['Tarsus Arena', 'Tarsus Museum', 'Tarneit Football Club', 'Tarsus Zoo', 'Tarporley Hunt Club', 'Tariotes', 'Tardona', 'Hagnon of Tarsus', 'Tarum', 'Tarsius', 'Tarucus', 'The Tartars', 'Tarutius', 'The Tarriers', 'Tarhipti', 'Tarsomys', 'Tarsus, Mersin', 'Tarsus City Stadium', 'Forever Tarkovsky Club', 'Tartus', 'Tarrha', 'Tarnos', 'Tarsus railway station', 'Tarsus American College', 'Tarves', 'Tārore', 'Tarsiger', 'Taroona Rugby Club', 'Tardive', 'Tărcaia', 'Tarsonemus', 'Tartarus', 'Tarquin Hall', 'The Tartans', 'Royal Tarragona Yacht Club', 'Tardes', 'Tarsal coalition', 'TAROM', 'Tar Heel League', 'Tarchia', 'TART Collective', 'Tar derby', 'Taroç family', 'Targonie', 'Tartarus Montes', ""Bachelors' Club, Tarbolton"", 'Tarfside', 'Tarsus (skeleton)', 'Tarigri', 'The Rankenian Club', 'Tarion', 'Tarragonès', 'Tarouca', 'Tarlina', 'Tarhari', 'Tarcisius', 'Tarsus (Bithynia)', 'Tarma', 'Tarvisio', 'Tariat', 'Tarsus Half Marathon', 'Taryn', 'Tarḫunna', 'Tarforst', 'The Northern Club', 'Tarcal', 'The Chameleon Club', 'Taruga', 'Tarsia', 'Helladius of Tarsus', 'Tarbes', 'Vermin Club', 'Tarhuna', 'Tarot Sport', 'Tarmonbarry', 'Targanice', 'Tarsus Waterfall', 'Tarnice', 'The Tart', 'Tarnów', 'Tariácuri', 'Tardenois', 'Roman Club', 'Taridius', 'Tarover', 'Tarbisu', 'Tàrrega', 'The Tarot Café', 'Tardigrade', 'Tarhos', 'Tarusa', 'The Huggabug Club', 'Tarkawica', 'Tartessos', 'Tarquinia', 'Tarerach', 'Tarna', 'Tarcenay', 'Tarentola', 'Tarraby']"

Functional temporalism," Functional temporalism is an anthropological theory drawing prominently from the functionalistic and postmodern schools of thought first discussed by Clifford Geertz. It is also heavily indebted to the symbolistic tradition in sociolinguistics. The theory ostensibly deals with the functional aspects of more traditional temporalism. Functional temporalists maintain that such paradigms are consistently overlooked by mainstream academics and that this greatly affects the interpretation of cultural articulations in an exceedingly pejorative sense. With increased pragmatism in academic ethnographic work, however, the social other is able to attain a more post-idealistic status in the cultural hierarchy. This should empower her to achieve a kind of social solipsism not precedented even by late-twentieth century Marxist methods of inquiry. Some critics of this school of thought have argued that though there were flaws in pre-naturalistic sociological theories, these flaws are better compensated for in more recent theories which deal with interpretative analyses in a more deontological sense. Functional temporalism, on the other hand, is decidedly teleological in its disdain for feminist ideologies. Many advocates of the theory do admit the exceedingly teleological outlook of functional temporalism is a weakness.",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/Functional temporalism,1,hoax_wikihoax_2023,"['Temporalities', 'Temporality', 'Temporal parts', 'Temporale', 'The Temporal Void', 'Temporal logic', 'Temporal case', 'Temporal logic of actions', 'Temporal expressions', 'Functional contextualism', 'Temporal (band)', 'Functional psychology', 'Temporal Process Language', 'Distributive-temporal case', 'Temporal motivation theory', 'Temporal isolation', 'Temporal (video game)', 'Functionalism (philosophy of mind)', 'Temporal envelope and fine structure', 'Temporal single-system interpretation', 'Linear temporal logic', 'Temporal scales', 'Temporal finitism', 'Temporal theory (hearing)', 'Biological functionalism', 'Temporal Synapse', 'Temporal network', 'Temporal annotation', 'Theory of functional systems', 'Structural functionalism', 'Functional movement', 'Temporal feedback', 'Temporal paradox', 'Time perception', 'Functionalism–intentionalism debate', 'Functional periodicity', 'The Nature of Time', 'Persistence of Time', 'Interval temporal logic', 'Functionalism (architecture)', 'Temporal encroachment', 'Functional specification', 'Time–manner–place', 'Functional selectivity', 'Functional brief', 'Temporal muscle', 'Temporal mean', 'Cadena temporal', 'Timed propositional temporal logic', 'Planum temporale', 'Functional linguistics', 'Metric temporal logic', 'Hierarchical temporal memory', 'Temporal resolution', 'Functional sentence perspective', 'Exploring Time', 'Time of Desires', 'Functional shift', 'Spatial–temporal reasoning', 'Functional design', 'On Time (disambiguation)', 'Functional organization', 'The Ravages of Time', 'Temporal database', 'The Fullness of Time', 'Passage Through Time', 'Temporal information retrieval', 'Being and Time', 'Functional analysis (psychology)', 'Temporal analysis of products', 'Purely functional programming', 'The Last Banquet of Temporal Confections', 'Functional (mathematics)', 'Mental time travel', 'Alternating-time temporal logic', 'Temporal clause (Latin)', 'Dynamic functional connectivity', 'Language Of Temporal Ordering Specification', 'Functionalism (international relations)', 'The Adolescence of Time', 'Design in Time', 'Connectionist temporal classification', 'Functional item', 'Passage of Time', 'Functional protocol', 'The Map of Time', 'The Unreality of Time', 'Layers of Time', 'Temporal typography', 'Functional programming', 'Temporal fossa', 'Visual temporal integration', 'Functional response', 'A Journey Through Time', 'Mental timeline', 'E.G.

Cohen, along with his father and uncle, co-own the Cohen Companies, a wine import and export company based out of Charlotte, North Carolina.

Along with his grandfather, he helped to build Cruse wines into one of the largest and most respected wine producers in the Southern United States. Cohen has traveled all over the United States promoting his family's brand and name, and he frequently offers expert reviews at wine tastings and for online sites such as www. wine. com. Cohen, along with producing quality wines, learned the art of chazzanut from his grandfather, Frank Birnbaum, the former cantor of Central Synagogue and Congregation Shaare Zedek (New York City). Singing as a cantor since the age of 15, Cohen has served pulpits all over the southeastern United States and California, most notably Congregation B'nai Israel in Boca Raton, Florida.

Reede-drum," The reede-drum (pronounced as reed) is a frame drum from Kyrgyzstan ranging from 25 to 65 cm (10"" to 26"") in diameter, with most drums measuring 35 to 45 cm (14"" to 18""). The sides of the drum are 9 to 20 cm (3½"" to 8"") deep. A goatskin head is tacked to one side (although nowadays, synthetic heads, or new materials like kangaroo skin, are sometimes used). The other side is open ended for one hand to be placed against the inside of the drum head to control the pitch and timbre. A double reed (similar to that of an oboe) projects from the frame of the drum. The reede-drum was used during the rebellion of 840 AD, by the Uyghur Khanate, as a battle drum. The drum was used to provide a cadence for the pipers and warriors to march to, as well as announce the arrival of the army. It has also been said that the Uyghur used the drum's tantalizing melodies put their enemy troops, like the Mongols, into a trance-like state. There are no known references to this particular name for a drum prior to the 9th century. The drum itself did not gain wide recognition until the Kyrgyzstan traditional music resurgence in the 1950s in which it became known through the work of The Clancy Brothers and others. Growing interest has led many music schools to incorporate the drum into percussion curriculum. New England Conservatory, Northwestern University, Florida State University and California State University have featured the reede-drum as the primary instrument of percussion majors. California State University Long Beach will also be the first university to designate a reed room especially for percussionists starting in 2008. The drum's growing popularity will likely influence other schools to follow suit. As of September 2009, twelve universities have incorporated the reede-drum into their curriculum. ]",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/Reede-drum,1,hoax_wikihoax_2023,"['Drumming Song', 'Drum (album)', 'Reed-Dossey House', 'Reedy River (musical)', 'The Drum (song)', 'Drum (EP)', 'Reed-Cooke', 'Reedsy', 'Drum Song', 'Reed trio', 'Thell Reed', 'Drums of Love', 'Alto Reed', 'Les Reed (songwriter)', 'Lou Reed (album)', 'Alan Reed (artist)', 'Drum', 'Drumheller-Chinook', 'Folkton Drums', 'Bass drum', 'Reed pipe', 'Drum Suite', 'Soul Drums', 'Reed (name)', 'Preston Reed (album)', 'Drum-Believable', 'Reed Cordish', 'Drum Island (band)', 'Heavenly Drum', 'The Drum Suite', 'The Drums (album)', 'Reed vole', 'The New Jimmy Reed Album', 'Reed-Wood Place', 'Jungle Drum', 'The Sound of Drums (album)', 'Paul Reed (artist)', 'Tin Drum (album)', 'Drumskinny', 'Kit Reed', 'Drum and bugle corps (classic)', 'Different Drum (album)', 'David Reed (artist)', 'Decies-within-Drum', 'The Drums', 'Tiny Reed', 'Metal (Preston Reed album)', 'Flower Drum Song', 'Drumlin (band)', 'Decies-without-Drum', 'Mike Reed (musician)', 'Hollow Reed', 'Reed Between the Lines', 'Crystal Reed', 'The Bells (Lou Reed album)', 'The Flower Drum Song', 'Alan Reed', 'Drum Beat', 'Drum beat', 'Drum Boogie', 'Drum solo', 'Black drum', 'Reed &amp; Reed', 'Tanoai Reed', 'Laugerie-Basse', 'The Walking Drum', 'Scott Reeder (drummer)', 'Groove (drumming)', 'Drum tablature', 'Drum (MØ song)', 'Footed drum', 'Bass Drum of Death', 'Dorset Drum', 'Ronnie Reed', 'Tenor drum', ""Drums O' Voodoo"", 'Keith Reed', 'Reedling', 'Valley of the Drums', 'The Ghost Drum', 'Orange County Drum and Percussion', 'Herb Reed', 'The Hollow Reed', 'George Reed (musician)', 'Sunday Reed', 'Tambourine, Drum', 'Dan Reeder (musician)', 'Konye-Urgench', 'Military Drums (song)', 'Lavant drum', 'Reed Gershwind', 'Vallée-Jonction', 'Tende (drum)', 'Drum machine', 'Groove-A-Thon', 'Deutsche Zeppelin Reederei', 'Lamazière-Basse', 'Flower Drum', 'Flower drum', 'William Reed (musician)']"

Strutt Family Trust," The Strutt Family Trust (IT694/2002) is a South African based family trust formed in 2002. Net assets of the trust are said to exceed US$41 Million, excluding the value of their private art collection. The The Strutt Family Trust (IT694/2002) has a founding history dating back to Sir Ernest Oppenheimer, whom along with American J. P. Morgan founded the Anglo American Corporation, a gold mining company, in 1917 with £1 million, raised from U. K. and U. S. sources. There are presently 4 trustees and 3 known beneficiaries. Stanley Ethelbert Strutt and Aldeth Olive Strutt (Nee Penwarden, daughter of Douglas C. Penwarden, Co-founder of Otto Landsburg and Penwarden) The Strutt Family Trust (IT694/2002) is heavily involved in international mining, tobacco,airlines (Turkish Airlines), fine art and property development activities. Nunamta Aulukestai (Caretakers of Our Land) and the Renewable Resources Coalition commissioned a report regarding Anglo American and their current and past subsidiaries and major shareholders. The report is written by Philip Mattera, a corporate reporter. The report, released in July 2008]], criticizes Anglo American and major shareholders]] for community, worker safety, public health, and environmental problems exclusively at their mining operations in South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Mali, Ireland, and the United States (Nevada) and notes the difference between Anglo's stated corporate goals and their actual corporate performance. The Strutt Family Trust (IT694/2002)claimed that they were merely known shareholders and that ultimately Anglo American had responsibility to rectify issues raised by the report, if this was not to be done they (The Strutt Family Trust (IT694/2002)) would sell their shares. With an initial grant of ZAR1. 1 million (US$ 220,000) from the Strutt Family Trust (IT694/2002), various international museums and reference libraries have been able to expand their collections. . Their noted influence in assisting artists, both in visual and performing arts from developing nations has recently been made public. Although “The Strutt Family Trust (IT694/2002)” was originally created for a large financial commitment with a clear distinction between philanthropy and charitable giving, which typically plays a supporting role in a charitable organization initiated by themselves. Thus, under the specific Trust Deed of The Strutt Family Trust (IT694/2002) it is clearly stated that the conventional usage of philanthropy by the trust will not only apply mainly to needy persons, but also to sometimes to a trust with a particular cause or objective targeted.",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/Strutt Family Trust,1,hoax_wikihoax_2023,"['The Family Survival Trust', 'Streatfeild family', 'Struthas', 'Strutter', 'ST200 family', 'In Family We Trust', 'Family and Childcare Trust', 'Strut', 'Stix family', 'Straif', 'Struthiola', 'Strut (TV series)', 'River Stour Trust', 'Schroders UK Public Private Trust', 'CSA Trust', 'Strutter (TV series)', 'Thestor strutti', 'Public trust', 'Public Trust', ""R.

Smoke Dance,"Smoke Dance, also called The Fast Floor Dance,[1] is a contemporary pow-wow dance that has evolved from the Longhouse ceremonial and social dances used by the Haudenosaunee Men and Women, familiarly known as the Six Nations.   The history of the evolution of this dance between the men and women’s dance is slightly different. In only that the origin of this Smoke Dance stems from ceremonies called Wasase,[2] an old time war dance/rain dance, danced strictly by the men. This dance was a slow tempo and the dance style of the men was very dramatic often displaying great movement and theatrical bravado that is sometimes translated as arrogance and pride. The dance often told a story of war and victory, and was also often used to incite the rain in the appropriate season. The women’s dance evolved from the social dances,[3] although currently both dances are very similar in fast footwork. The differences between the men and women are in the style and grace portrayed by each dancer. Today the songs sung for these contests vary between fast and slow songs, old time war songs and fast smoke songs which are derived from longhouse social songs. The men are the only ones to dance the old time war dance songs which are a slower beat, but with much more theatrics and they also dance to the up-tempo contemporized version of the music, which is the fast smoke song. The women only dance to varying tempos of the fast smoke songs but with grace and style.[1] The songs are sung by one singer and he uses a water drum or deer skin drum to accompany him. It is up to the discretion of the singer what type of song to sing and the speed at which the song will be sung. Sometimes it seems to be a contest between the singer and the dancer, to see who can out do who. It is enthralling to witness. There is a myth that the Smoke dance originated directly within the longhouse, there is no evidence to support that theory. The myth goes like this: due to the structure of the longhouse and the use of open fire pits within the longhouse, the smoke from the fire would circulate within the longhouse and sometimes create too much smoke[4] The men and women were said to get up in the longhouse and begin moving their hands and arms (and feet) around in sweeping motions trying to circulate the smoke and get it to leave the longhouse. This movement gradually culminating into a type of dance that is now called the smoke dance. Again this is a myth and has no evidence to prove it. Clothing worn by men and women in the contemporary powwow circle for this dance varies with each nation, i.e. Oneida, Mohawk, Seneca, Onondaga, Cayuga, or Tuscarora. Commonly, each male dancer will wear a Gustoweh,[5] (a headdress worn by the Iroquois men) but each Gustoweh identifies them as belonging to a specific Six Nations tribe. Also, the men wear ribbon shirts with adornments that vary from simple to extravagant and leggings, breaches, cuffs and moccasins. Additional adornments may be worn for flare and individual style. The women clothing are similar as well. Women’s clothing consists of a tunic that ranges from simple to extravagant, skirt, leggings, cape, cuffs and a head piece that can vary from a simple collection of turkey feathers to an extravagantly adorned cap or crown.[6] When referencing dancers clothing, always refer to as it regalia, not costumes. The reason the Smoke Dance has evolved from the longhouse is due to the popularity of the dance itself. The younger Iroquois men wanted to show their agility and great capabilities at keeping time with the beat of the drum, the older men wanted to see just how fast these young men could dance and still keep time with the drum.[1] It began as a contest between the singer and the dancer. As the songs became faster the popularity of the dance increased. Over time the dancer and the singer took the dance to the public to exhibit the style and culture of the Haudenosaunee people. The Smoke Ddance has been out of the longhouse for decades now and has enjoyed a renaissance that has taken it from the longhouse to exhibitions to the pow-wow circle. The critical elements that gave birth to the smoke dance have stayed within the longhouse and what is now enjoyed by the public, contest dancers and exhibitioners is an evolved style of dance that began in the longhouse and is unique to the Six Nations People.

Brahmanical See," Brahmanical See refers to the domain of certain Hindu leaders in the Indian subcontinent. Because it is essentially an Anglicized term (compare episcopal see), this nomenclature has begun to fall into disuse. Much like the former Indian principalities, which varied in scale from small estates to vast kingdoms, the brahmanical sees range from minor parishes to quasi-states. With Hinduism itself lacking any central organizing institutions, it is common for brahmanical sees to geographically overlap with one another, just as the sees of different Christian denominations can coexist within a shared geography. A religious leader over a Brahmanical See is typically known as a maharaj, or in European terms, a prince of the faith. The office is generally passed down the generations in the male line within an extended family, though not necessarily from father to son. Again, similar to the tensions which existed in medieval Europe between the papacy and the aristocracy, tensions between the brahmanical maharajs and the royal maharajas constantly were an issue throughout much of the history of India. The brahmanical maharajs could bestow or withhold the legitimacy without which royal maharajas could not reign, and the royal maharajas could extend or withdraw the military protection without which brahmanical maharajs might not survive. The longest established brahmanical sees are the Brahmanical See of Rajasthan (which contains a large number of kingdoms), the Brahmanical See of Mysore (whose borders are coterminal with those of the Kingdom of Mysore), and the Brahmanical See of Dabra (which is one of several sees contained within the Kingdom of Gwalior). With the dissolution of the old kingdoms and the coming of modernity, the importance of the brahmanical sees declined sharply in the last quarter century. The see of Rajasthan is now held by an Indo-Canadian, the see of Mysore is disputed by three claimants, and the see of Dabra has been allowed to lapse entirely.",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/Brahmanical See,1,hoax_archieved,"['Brahmanagudem', 'Brahman', 'Brahmanoli', 'Brahmana', 'Brahmani', 'Brahman (disambiguation)', 'Brahmanandam', 'Para Brahman', '1st Brahmans', 'Brahman (band)', 'Brahman languages', 'Brahmanbaria', 'Brahmanand S.

Gold Tea," Gold Tea is a brand of iced tea that is originally from the Confederate States of America in the 19th century. It was famous for containing large quantities of small flakes of gold in each cup. This was done not purely for aesthetics, but as a means of smuggling Confederate gold through Union blockades. The public became aware of this action during the trial of Colonel Ryan Mooney of Pennsylvania. Mooney was sentenced to death by firing squad for his role in smuggling the tea to the North on behalf of Colonel Jackson. Gold tea largely disappeared after the American Civil War, as the Confederacy no longer required gold to issue money or bribe foreign governments. The idea lived on in the alcoholic beverage Goldschlager. This gold-related article is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it. This brand-name food or drink product–related article is a stub.

Fredric Croix and Quickslide Rick," Fredric Croix and Quickslide Rick (aka Rickli Briski) were two miners and blues musicians from Gwinn, Michigan in the 1920s who were influenced by Ramblin' Thomas, and other Delta blues artists. They were briefly signed to RCA Victor where they released a string of unsuccessful 78 rpm records. The two were on RCA for the 1928 and 1929 years. All their master tapes were lost in the 1960s when RCA destroyed their Camden warehouse. There recordings have little demand among the 78 rpm record collecting community, and are almost impossible to find. Fredric, and Quickslide suffered through the great depression, both were laid off as the great depression closed the mines in Gwinn. Fredric Moved to southern Michigan, and later died in an industrial accident while working in a paper mill in the Kalamazoo, Michigan area.

The Lying Student," The Lying Student (Czech: Ležící Studenta) is a Czech satirical poem written by Jára Svěrák, framed as a traditional epic poem. It was originally written in 1914, but its publication was stalled due to the outbreak of World War I. It was not released until the 1980s. The poem is a work of absurdist fiction. The poem is divided into four sections. Jára Svěrák, a poor man from Prague, wrote the text over almost a decade. It was submitted to several literary journals, but was rejected. A few copies were made at the author's expense, which received critical acclaim. However, these copies were later suppressed, and are now lost. Shortly afterward, Jára was drafted into the Austro-Hungarian Army. He was killed in battle in 1917. Following the author's death, the original manuscript's whereabouts became unknown. It is thought to have been in the possession of Edward Rydz-Śmigły prior to the German invasion of Poland in 1939, where it was seized by Nazi officials. After World War II it again went missing. Most of the manuscript was rediscovered in an antique shop in 1981. Historians debate whether Jára, the son of an uneducated peasant, could have written the text, which frequently references obscure mythology, Marxist concepts and classical literature. Many Polish people believe Edward Rydz-Śmigły to be the poem's author; however, it is unlikely that Rydz, a Polish military leader, would have written a poem in Czech. Literary critic Jan Čulík has suggested a young Karel Čapek as the poem's true author, citing the author's interest in surrealism and political satire. {{DEFAULTSORT:Lying Student}} ] ] ] ] ]",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/The Lying Student,1,hoax_wikihoax_2023,"['Student', 'Child lying', 'The Good Student', 'The Student (short story)', 'The Perfect Student', 'Lying (disambiguation)', 'The National Student', 'The Student Boarder', 'John Lie (professor)', 'The Student School', 'Student prank', 'The Homeless Student', 'Sleeping Freshmen Never Lie', 'Student teacher', 'The Students', 'Class of Lies', 'Perpetual student', 'Liar (disambiguation)', 'The Medical Student', 'The Student (2016 film)', 'Liar Liar (disambiguation)', 'Student (film)', 'Student of the Year', 'Student (disambiguation)', 'The Student Teachers', 'The Student Prince', 'The Truthful Liar', 'His Best Student', 'The Lying Detective', 'Liar Liar GE2017', 'The Four-Faced Liar', 'Student leader', 'Pathological lying', 'Liard (disambiguation)', 'The Student Life', 'Student Seduction', 'Academic dishonesty', 'The Young Teacher', 'Dakota Student', 'StudentAdvisor', 'Victims of Deception', 'Lying (film)', 'Student affairs', 'The Liar (short story)', 'Student Number 1', 'The Man Who Lies', 'Kurt Student', 'Lying in state', 'Liar paradox', 'Student Body Right', 'Student SPILL', 'Student of the Game', 'Young Liars', 'The Cambridge Student', 'Liar!

Fyckshenhall," Fyckshenhall (pronounced /fɪərk-ʒʌn-ʌl/), sometimes written as Fychshenhall, is a hamlet in the civil parish of Mary Tavy in the West Devon district of Devon, England. Its nearest town is Tavistock, which lies approximately 1. 2 miles (1. 9 km) south-west of the hamlet. Fyckshenhall is situated adjacent to the A386 road near Wilminstone and consists of approximately a dozen residences and a church, St. Bartholomew's. The hamlet's name comes from the old English fyckshen, meaning ""the place where the land is wet"". This is understandable as its location is in the confluence of the River Tavy and its tributary, locally known as the River Richy but officially as the River Wallabrooke. The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book under its original name of Fyckenhow and there is evidence of settlement there dating back to late antiquity. The church, named for St. Bartholomew the Obtuse, is first mentioned in approximately 1313. There is little remaining evidence of the original Gothic building, however, the majority of the church dating from the 17th century. Fyckshenhall Halt stood on the Plymouth, Devonport and South Western Junction Railway line from Bere Alston to Lydford; the line and the halt closed on 6 May 1968. The large railway viaduct (Bridge No. 652) where the line crosses the Wallabrooke still exists today. Next to Fyckshenhall Halt was a railway incline serving Wilminstone Quarry.

Oyster Injustice," The Oyster Injustice of 1834-1835 was the result of an unusually poor oyster season in the Chesapeake Bay fishery and President Andrew Jackson's withdrawing of federal funding from the national bank. Dozens of fishermen lost their boats when they defaulted on loans made by state and local banks. The federal bank had previously allowed fishermen to defer loan payments during years of poor harvest. This policy was maintained by banks in Maryland, but Virginia banks were quick to foreclose on loans regardless of circumstances. After the bumper harvest of 1835, many of the boats previously owned by the Virginia fisherman were sold by the banks to the now prosperous Maryland oystermen. This heightened already tense relations between the two groups, who had previously fought over fishing rights in the Chesapeake Bay. Frustrations of the Virginia fisherman culminated in the burning of at least two of the boats they had previously owned. Many historians attribute the particularly brutal treatment of Maryland prisoners by Confederate soldiers from the Virginian coast, during the American Civil War, to the Oyster Injustice. In 1973, Grand Funk Railroad wrote a song about the incident called ""Oyster Injustice Is Us. "" The band often played the song in their concerts, but never recorded the song in the studio.",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/Oyster Injustice,1,hoax_wikihoax_2023,"['Oyster Wars', 'Oyster', 'Oyster (novel)', 'The Oyster Question', 'The Oyster Eater', 'InJustice', 'Injustice', 'The Oyster Princess', 'Oysterband', 'The Oyster Meal', 'Oystering', 'Rock oyster', 'Oyster (album)', 'Oyster Rock', 'Oyster Bowl', 'Operation Oyster', 'Oyster (company)', 'Oysters (short story)', 'Pacific oyster', 'Oyster cracker', 'Oyster pirate', 'Oysterhead', 'Private Oyster', 'Eastern oyster', 'Oyster (disambiguation)', 'Oyster card', 'Oyster Rocks', 'Oystercatcher', 'Oyster bar', 'Oyster farming', 'Oyster Harbors', 'Oyster Village', 'Oyster ice cream', 'Prairie oyster', 'Prairie Oyster', 'The Oyster Box (South Africa)', 'Oyster reef', 'Oyster crab', 'Oyster Farmer', 'Injustice 2', 'Supreme Injustice', 'Suminoe oyster', 'Oyster Feast', 'Oyster (magazine)', 'Oysterhaven', 'Oyster, Virginia', 'The Oyster Eater (Ensor)', 'Black oystercatcher', 'Raid on Oyster River', 'Oyster sauce', 'Oyster Bed Bridge', 'J.

Henry Abner," Henry Abner (September 17, 1884 – July 10, 1935) was the pen name of policeman and fiction author Henry Abner Sturdivant. Abner was a well-known but commercially unsuccessful writer of golden era hard-boiled detective novels and short stories (active 1925–1935). Abner's death in 1935 led to him being nearly forgotten during the post-war heyday of detective fiction. In fact, Abner is probably best remembered today as the butt of scorn from Raymond Chandler in his 1950 essay ""The Simple Art of Murder"", in which Chandler lampoons Abner's first novel Death Wears Yellow Garters. Henry Abner Sturdivant was the fourth of six children born to John Patrick and Susan Frances Sturdivant. The Sturdivants were a prominent rural planter family from Taliaferro County, Georgia, although little is known about Abner's childhood. Abner followed in the footsteps of his older brothers in choosing a career in law enforcement. Eldest surviving brother Thurman Olin (T. O. ) Sturdivant would eventually become Chief of Police of the City of Atlanta, and next eldest brother William Jefferson Sturdivant was a railroad detective for the Pinkerton detective agency. Before becoming a police officer, Abner spent time working the cotton fields with relatives in Echols County, Georgia, near the Florida border. The time he spent there, though brief, would be influential in his writing, as the backwoods swamp would become a favorite setting for future work. Abner married Lora Maddie Campbell on March 26, 1922. They produced only one child, a daughter named Sara (born September 20, 1928). Abner joined the police force of Washington, GA in 1915 and was promoted to chief by the summer of 1925. Although a strict man, Abner, or Chief Sturdivant as he was known, was popular with locals, and particularly well-liked amongst Washington’s African American population. Henry Abner Sturdivant was killed in the line of duty on July 4, 1935. His injuries were sustained when he was thrown from the running board of a stolen automobile, as Abner attempted to apprehend the suspect. The suspect, Tom Booker, drove through Washington’s town square where Abner and another officer waited to make an arrest. Abner was treated in the local hospital for six days, but finally succumbed to his injuries on July 10. Booker was tried and convicted, and received a life sentence for the death of Chief Sturdivant. Abner was buried in his family’s plot in Sharon Methodist Church, Taliaferro County, Georgia. Abner was both stimulated and bored with the life of a small town lawman. He had known little else but the quiet peace of rural Georgia, except for the fantastic journeys he was able to take through fantastic literature. He was an avid reader, and began writing in order to see stories with characters that he liked, in settings he could relate to. Although he had been writing since as early as 1920, his first piece was not accepted for publication until 1925’s “Cold, Dark Night”, when it was released in an early summer issue of Flynn’s. In a 1934 interview Abner stated that, unlike other writers of his time, he was not seeking recognition or even financial gain: “I write because I have to. Now, I make a comfortable living as a police officer, but the stories satisfy something in me that money and fame never could. ” Abner without exception featured male protagonists in his stories. As was typical for the genre and the time in which he was writing, Abner’s work reflects the idea that women were regarded as weak and weak-willed, and often served as a source of trouble for the ubiquitously male heroes. His heroes were never repeated, although they often differed in name only, as many of them share almost identical backgrounds and traits. It has been speculated that Abner was trying to “find the perfect protagonist” by slightly tweaking his formula with each new work. The fact that he never found this perfection, and that he never offered readers repeat adventures with the same main characters, may very well have led to his lack of popular success. As can be expected from an author raised in rural antebellum Georgia, racial stereotypes also play heavily into Abner’s work. Although in some instances he was recognized for including sympathetic minority characters at all, even if they were only sidekicks to the ubiquitously white male protagonists. His work was appreciated by contemporary writers, but found little popular support and generally poor readership, which may be a leading factor in why his pieces are so difficult to find today. His unique slant on the hard-boiled detective tale, especially when considering the less-than-ordinary but far-from-exotic locales and cultures represented, were a big hit with colleagues, but lacked mainstream appeal and commercial success. In fact, Abner’s style was used as a precautionary warning for aspiring writers in the publishing industry. A leading modern theory is that Abner’s rural southern heritage made his writing unfit for recognition in a landscape dominated by northern and western, primarily urban, publishers and critics. All the novels except Heaven Needs Heroes were originally serialized in three, four, or five parts in various magazines. {{DEFAULTSORT:Abner, Henry}} ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/Henry Abner,1,hoax_wikihoax_2023,"['Henry Brunner', 'Henry L.

Ocular citrosis," Ocular Citrosis is a common infection of the eye generally resulting from periodic exposure to acidic substances, such as citrus fruit. It was first documented by Scottish physician Douglas Maclagan in 1860. Ocular Citrosis is most common among industrial workers who habitually experience alterations of pH in their work day. A test conducted in 1991 at the Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute demonstrated that ocular citrosis can be caused by the extended exposure of the eye to supposedly harmless acids, including citrus fruits. This discovery led to a brief public panic, which Alfred T. Murrough, head of the project, dismissed as ""pure hypochondria:"" The results from our tests merely confirm what has already been hypothesized about the condition. We already know that people get ocular citrosis from acids. The truth is that, if you are foolish enough to put a fruit in your eye, you are more likely to contract the disease. We've been eating fruit for millions of years without this being a problem. All that the Sanford study has shown is that there is a real correlation between putting citric acid--fruits--in your eyes, and blindness . Despite this, in the decade after the Sanford-Burnham studies, incidences of Ocular citrosis dropped by 50%, due to public awareness of the issue. As the condition develops, clear vision is compromised. A loss of visual acuity is noted. Contrast sensitivity is also lost, so that contours, shadows and color vision are less vivid. Veiling glare can be a problem as light is scattered by the cataract into the eye. A contrast sensitivity test should be performed and if a loss in contrast sensitivity is demonstrated an eye specialist consultation is recommended. If left untreated, chronic fatigue subsequently occurs. Many people are unaware that they have been infected until the disease has reached its later stages, at which point it is generally not treatable. If identified early, Ocular citrosis is easily cured through medication. However, because of the subtle nature of the infection, it is often left untreated, leading to permanent loss of vision similar to that of cataracts sufferers. In general, it is advisable to avoid incidences that involve excessive exposure to acidic substances. A growing group of historians believe that the Greek poet Homer may have contracted a harsh form of Ocular Citrosis as a child, from the exiguous descriptions of his blindness. This is still under considerable debate.",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/Ocular citrosis,1,hoax_wikihoax_2023,"['Ocular neurosis', 'Ocularis Infernum', 'Eye disease', 'Hypercompe ocularia', 'Ocular immune system', 'Ceroprepes ophthalmicella', 'Pathogenic Ocular Dissonance', 'Ocular dysmetria', 'Eutropis macularia', 'Ocular (disambiguation)', 'Acleris ophthalmicana', 'Association for Ocular Pharmacology and Therapeutics', 'Ocular hypertension', 'Oscularia', 'Conjunctivitis', 'Circomphalus', 'Cutaneous and Ocular Toxicology', 'Pustularia cicercula', 'Ocular ischemic syndrome', 'Ocular rosacea', 'Opercularia', 'Smerinthus ophthalmica', 'Ophthalmoparesis', 'Internuclear ophthalmoplegia', 'Vision disorder', 'Iris unguicularis', 'Ophthalmitis viridior', 'Citrobacter', 'Acute retinal necrosis', 'Blood–ocular barrier', 'Optic neuritis', 'Ocular albinism', 'Ocular myasthenia', 'International Council of Ophthalmology', 'Hypercallia citroclista', 'Progressive outer retinal necrosis', 'Eye strain', 'Ophthalmotrope', 'Pseudophilautus ocularis', 'Acantholiparis opercularis', 'Green-backed white-eye', 'Iris bostrensis', 'Cream-throated white-eye', 'Optic papillitis', 'Ocular larva migrans', 'Eye injury', 'Curio citriformis', 'Spondylo-ocular syndrome', 'Tethea ocularis', 'Comocritis circulata', 'Oculariini', 'Age-Related Eye Disease Study', 'Ocular dominance', 'Ocular straylight', 'Visual pathway lesions', 'Cicadella viridis', 'Keratoconjunctivitis', 'Eye Health UK', 'Stenoporpia glaucomarginaria', 'Rotaract', 'EyeCarePro', ""Purtscher's retinopathy"", 'Disruptive eye mask', 'Retinopathy', 'Herpes zoster ophthalmicus', 'Hypotrix ocularis', 'Ophthalmotilapia', 'Iris cuniculiformis', 'Central serous retinopathy', 'Acleris compsoptila', 'Cirsonella romettensis', 'Ocularist', 'Actinic conjunctivitis', 'Peroneal retinacula', 'Ocular tremor', 'Porocephaliasis', 'Corneal ectatic disorders', 'Cilix glaucata', 'Blue eye disease', 'Dry eye syndrome', 'Cine lens', 'European Ophthalmic Pathology Society', 'Eye neoplasm', 'Retinal vasculitis', 'Progressive retinal atrophy', 'Cimex lectularius', 'Cicadellini', 'Iris nusairiensis', 'Cimensis', 'Enteromyxum scophthalmi', 'Neuromyelitis optica', 'Cinygmula', 'Mollusc eye', 'The Unsleeping Eye', 'Neonatal conjunctivitis', 'Ophthalmoscopy', 'Grey-throated white-eye', 'Balanitis circinata', 'Macularia sylvatica', 'Acanthamoeba keratitis']"

Haď Čarém," Haď Čarém (Arabic: حاجي كريم Hājji ‘Karīm ) (886 – 937) was a Hungarian Muslim merchant and economist attached to the royal court of the Bohemians in the 10th century. Of Christian birth, he converted to Islam in the course of his interactions with foreign traders. As a theorist he was given some attention in Czech Communist historiography as a contributor to the fund of ‘pre-Marxist political economy’ and because of an attempted religious/peasant revolt. Čarém was born in 886 to the Palad (Paladža), a pagan family which would have Christian conversion. He was known as Gero (Giro) Iaromar in his Christian life and was sent to work as a mercenary in the army of Spytihněv Přemyslid against invading specific Magyars tribes. Here he gained the crucial martial experience needed for his future revolt. After 922 he enters the records of the court of Václav of the Czechs as an adviser to the senior financial courtier. He has himself become a merchant of goods near the capital, coming into contact with diverse traders purportedly even the ‘Chazars’ (probably just traders of Crimean origin instead) and interacted particularly with Cumans. The few available accounts hold that he converted to Islām through specifically Cuman traders with those of antagonistic views calling him a ‘Cumanian heathen’. His dietary habits and mannerisms changed and after the winter of 926 he returned from a leave of absence in the capital and rumors began that he had undertaken the Hājj although in public he largely retained the appearance of a Christian. Within the court he began to exert some influence on the economic policy of Duke Václav and encouraged him to propagate the monotheistic faith. He also supported the abolition of petty counties, bureaucratic tendencies in the treasury and argued for the church to cooperate with the court in the construction of road and trade networks. His opponents accused him of wanting a monopoly on trade and in fact he advocated expelling all East Frankish and Nordic traders, citing intrigues against the well-being of the realm. Around 929 an attempt was made on his life upon which he retaliated by calling for the construction of a system of guardhouses and supply routes so that the tradesmen of Bohemia walk and ride ‘in conditions of ideal serenity of which the Romans can now only dream’. In 931 he constituted a faction within the court's financial center advocating the economic merger of church and state so that ‘man aspiring to the image of God’ and ‘man with his powers bestowed upon him’ were brought into line and put into practice. He was opposite the faction supportive of the Eastern Franks, who he argued were influenced by the ‘Germans’ of England who ‘hold the realm hostage and prolong its period of growth’. As head of his faction he advocated the establishment of extensive trade routes into Turkic territories and greater contacts with the Arab world. He spoke with particular admiration of Damascus, where he claimed works of sound constitution and aesthetic value resided, and brought with him into the court architectural plans for a number of such buildings which he claimed were of universal infrastructural significance. For these and other ‘heterodox’ views he came under suspicion from Christian authorities and his enemies exploited this. He denounced them, attributing their views to common adherence towards East Frankish and Anglo-Saxon policies which he viewed as fundamentally against economic development and ‘far away from the aspiration of the image of God’. He faced another assassination attempt in 932 under the direction of one Basilio wherein his right arm was severed. He attributed this to Anglo-Venetian intrigue on account of the attempted murderer being member of the staff of Guido, the Venetian legate to the court who was later found to have conspired with the Anglo-Saxon representative on financial matters. In his report to the court on finances shortly thereafter he claimed that ‘the All-Majestic brought into the world the doctrine of Joseph to create society and shelter it from all that He has given and thence, implicitly, gave us the doctrine of man's powers over the world for us to multiply as He commands‘. This formed the basis of his economic proposals. In 934 he addressed a memorandum to the Duke where he laid out the dealings the Bohemians had with the Cumans, advocating further trade with them and the establishment of relations with the Cuman courts. This raised the ire of the Eastern Franks who had reduced Bohemia to a vassalized state. They called for either his execution or exile into Cumans lands so that he may live as a slave. He responded to such threats: It is not clear to me why a man must be in direct subservience to another man, or a realm in direct subservience to another's court, far from the narrow perspectives of these men I have in my hands the ability to create for , endowed to me by the Almighty, whose doctrines entrust in all the independence and development necessary for each to prosper, while it is evident that slavery and subservience retards development in the long march of man both as a relation between men and between polities. Because of such views he is considered in Czech Communist historiography as an ‘incipient anti-colonialist and anti-slavery advocate’ and forerunner of Quidort's theories on the equality of states as a condition for their mutual progress. His opponents petitioned the Duke to expel him from the court, but despite Václav's own Christian faith there was hesitancy in expelling an energetic financier, some of whose economic advice the Duke favored. It was decided that he instead be sent on a mission throughout the countryside in order to assess the possibilities of the realm in guarding against diseases and infestations. While undertaking this task he was accused by some townsfolk of proselytizing Islām. He was brought before the Duke to account for these claims and responded first by delivering his report and second by discussing his religious views. In his report he noted that the populace of the countryside was ‘at the mercy of the Most Just ’ and claiming that peasants were reduced to prostrating themselves before inanimate objects (trees, enclosures, walls of domains, et cetera) begging for forgiveness from their deity. The suggestions he made to alleviate the situation of the peasantry and prepare them against contagion were not acted on for centuries, given attention only in 1771 when governor Karl Egon von Fürstenberg implemented many of them to stave off the threat of famine in Bohemia, later recommending them for use across the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The contents of the discussion of religion no longer exist, but he continued his presence in the court although he was no longer called upon for specific tasks or permitted to advise the Duke. In 935 Duke Václav was slain by his brother Boleslav. Iaromar ceases being mentioned in court records shortly thereafter. A year later he revisited the countryside and spoke to the peasants, using his economic knowledge to his benefit by explaining to a number of them the theories which Czechoslovak Communist historiography compared to the later writings of Ibn Khaldūn. He used his one-time experience as a mercenary to organize raids against merchant houses rivaling his while using the proceeds of his own mercantile activities to finance the acquisition of arms from a fellow Bohemian merchant named Vsebor, who together with a peasant named Dietmar constituted the leadership of the rebellion who subsequently adopted the names Ibrahim and Aziz. The would-be rebels assembled in the Bohemian Forest in 8 bands divided into about 10 men each. In light of his obvious superiority in intellect and being the only one with battle experience, Čarém (having disposed of his Christian name) was declared their leader and he called himself Haď (Hajji) to be differentiated from the others. Their political program, insofar as it is known, involved literacy for the peasants so that they could escape from ignorance, expulsion of Eastern Frankish influence from the realm, the abolition of interest and seizure of the lands of those who opposed these policies. The would-be rebels distributed a number of their own to the countryside to spread and explain these views. In an 1895 summary on the peasant movement, touching briefly on early Bohemian lands, Josef Kaizl wrote that ‘the revolt of the Hadži aroused interest not just in the Moslem but even the Christian believer accustomed to penury to which some saw only the Moslem faith with its charity as redemption’. The would-be rebels met with resistance on the part of the court, which sent its forces and allied peasants to hunt down the Haď's men in the forest. During one battle the Haď declared: Let us remember that the asses of the world sit upon their thrones and judge us not piteously, but bastardy against Allāh. We will take by conquest the lands and the society, the commerce and the men in arms, for all the asses must render account to Allāh who has ownership over them, who are his slaves and who tend to him on this world, though they know not. As Winter neared the Haď developed what was likely pneumonia. One of his last acts was to write on Aristotle's views on human labor, notes which were later confiscated by the Bohemian authorities and which when read hundreds of years later constituted ‘analyses strikingly similar to those made by K. Marx in Capital on Aristotle's conception of value’. Constantly being pursued by the enemy and dogged by his illness, the Haď's condition worsened and he died, his last words being that ‘there is no God but Allāh who we uphold and aspire to seek however imperfectly as He is, perfection’. His followers were hanged shortly after and the movement suppressed. In the Czech Communist period it was denied that he was of anything other than Czech birth and blood. This is because of nationalist reasons but also because of his words about the future Czechs. He argued near his death that Allāh would mercifully punish the Czech Christians via assimilation into the superior grasp of culture, economics, et cetera pursued by the Moslems through ‘divide et impera’ and numerical strength for ‘the Mohammedan sees no state but the Ummāh’. {{DEFAULTSORT:Carem, Had}} ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/Haď Čarém,1,hoax_archieved,"['CAREM', 'Carem', 'Careem', 'Carel', 'CAREN', 'Caret', 'Carenno', 'Careby', 'Care2', 'Carema', 'Carew Mildmay', 'Carentan', 'Diem', 'Carepa', 'Careto', 'Carev Most', 'Carew (surname)', 'Carentoir', 'Carennac', 'OMA DRM', 'HadGEM1', 'Caren (name)', 'Ora Carew', 'Diegem', 'Carel Fourie', 'Carevikj', 'Caretas', 'John Carew', 'Carei', 'Had', 'Careri', 'Vem', 'Carex aurea', 'Hadoram', 'Caren Sonn', 'Carex', 'True Care', 'Paym', 'Carers UK', 'Carex riparia', 'Total care', 'Carenage', 'Carezzano', 'Wymond Carew', 'Carex barbarae', 'FitSM', 'DWSM', 'Stan Carew', 'SuperM', 'SUPERM', 'Carex adusta', 'Hassim', 'The Carer', 'Carel Goseling', 'Charles Carew', 'DXYM', 'Carex davalliana', 'Care work', 'Carel Willink', 'Wayne Carew', 'Carex rosea', 'SIMM', 'Caren Kemner', 'Carex specifica', 'Carepalxis', 'Shem', 'Dwm', 'Caremark', 'Carex inversa', 'Careca', 'Managed care', 'Baron Carew', 'Malm', 'Carex tenera', 'FVWM', 'CareFlite', 'Carex angustata', 'Thiram', 'Carew Tower', 'Care Opinion', 'Care UK', 'Romana Carén', 'Carew Cross', 'Evergem', 'Shechem', 'MedChemComm', 'Handle Me with Care', 'Caregiver', 'CareCloud', 'ParM', 'William Carew Hazlitt', 'Da Lem', 'John F.

Sephardic Temple Adat David," Sephardic Temple Adat David is a Jewish synagogue located in uptown Charlotte, North Carolina. Founded in 1919, it is the oldest and only active Sephardic congregation in the Carolinas. The first Sephardic Jew to arrive in Charlotte was a merchant by the name of Abraham Matalon, who came in 1896. Eventually, more Sephardim began to arrive between 1908-1918. By the end of World War I, the Sephardic community in Charlotte consisted of approximately 30 families, mostly Greek Jews from Rhodes and Salonica. These families established the first congregation, Beth David, in 1919. Unlike Sephardic communities in other parts of the United States, most of these Greek Sephardim assimilated into Jewish life in Charlotte alongside their Ashkenazic neighbors. Many of these families, who were merchants and storekeepers, quickly began to amass wealth and affluence within the Charlotte community from other endeavors such as real estate and banking. In 1926, several prominent families constructed the current building on Caldwell Street. A Byzantine Revival structure, it is capable of holding approximately 500 people at maximum capacity. Its dome, more than 80 feet (24 m) tall, is one of the tallest domed structures in Charlotte. Atop the dome, sits a windowed keter or ""crown"" symbolizing the superiority or kingliness of God in Kaballah. In 1949, an adjacent education building was constructed. By the 1950's, the small yet vibrant Beth David, known colloquially as ""The Sephardic Temple,"" consisted of approximately 75 families with a Talmud Torah of approximately 30 students. The congregation was led by a chazzan with visiting rabbis for High Holy Days. In 1957, the Temple made the unique decision to allow for ""mixed seating"" on Shabbat, which was quite unusual for a Sephardic Orthodox community at the time. Separate seating was still maintained for High Holy Days. Following Fidel Castro's rise to power in Cuba, most Cuban Jews fled to the United States. Mostly settling in Miami, Florida, several Ashkenazic and Sephardic families came to Charlotte as well. Upon their arrival, these Cuban Sephardim (mostly of Syrian and Turkish descent) found the ""mixed seating"" and more liberal positions of Beth David not suited to their liking. Thus, the leaders of this group of Cuban Jewish immigrants established the ""Congregacion Hebreo de Adat Yeshurun"" (Hebrew Congregation of Adat Yeshurun) in 1961. This congregation met in a store front on College Street for several years. In the mid 1970's both congregations, which had seen decline in their numbers due to intermarriage with Ashkenazim and death, decided to begin discussions about a possible merger. At this time, Beth David employed a rabbi, Rabbi Uriel Behar, who agreed to serve both congregations if a merger were to take place. So, in 1978 both congregations merged and took the amalgamated name ""Sephardic Temple Adat David"" as a tribute to both communities' history. In 1987, the nearby family-built synagogue in Salisbury, North Carolina, Beth Sadeh Synagogue, agreed to merge with Adat David and donate its Judaica and Torah scrolls for preservation. Today, Adat David maintains a small, but active community with approximately 80 families. Its rabbi, Daniel Azoulay, arrived in 2002 and is actively engaged in the Charlotte Jewish community. In 2007, he became the first rabbi in North Carolina history to be awarded the Order of the Long Leaf Pine for his work with inner-city youth and the homeless.",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/Sephardic Temple Adat David,1,hoax_wikihoax_2023,"['Sephardic Temple Tifereth Israel', 'Sephardic Temple (Constanța)', 'David Temple', 'Temple of the Delians', 'Temple Adath Israel of the Main Line', 'Temple Israel', 'Temple of Al-Lat', ""Solomon's Temple"", 'Temple in Jerusalem', 'Markandeshwar Temple', 'Abeyadana Temple', 'Peoples Temple', 'Anandeshwaram Mahadeva Temple', 'Temple', 'Beit David', 'Dule Temple', 'Temple House of Israel', 'Third Temple', 'Bhuleshwar Temple', ""Solomon's Temple (disambiguation)"", 'Temple name', 'Egyptian temple', 'Mahakali Temple, Adiware', 'Temple of Maharraqa', 'Keezhtali Mahadeva Temple', 'Mahadev Temple, Deobaloda', 'Veeramakaliamman Temple, Arantangi', ""B'Nai Zion Temple"", 'Markandeshwar Siva Temple', 'Temple of Baalshamin', 'Anandavalleeshwaram Sri Mahadevar Temple', 'Dhakeshwari Temple', 'Thrichattukulam Mahadeva Temple', 'Temple of Bacchus', 'Thiru Aadanoor Temple', 'Hasanamba temple', ""Solomon's Temple, Buxton"", 'Alanduraiappar Temple, Nallatthukkudi', 'Ettumanoor Mahadevar Temple', 'Temple of Solomon (São Paulo)', 'Abirameswarar temple', 'Nalpathaneeswaram Sree Mahadeva Temple', 'Temple of Israel (Wilmington, North Carolina)', 'Pasupatheeswarar Temple, Aavoor', ""Temple B'Nai Israel (Olean, New York)"", 'Adat Shiva Temple', 'Temple of Seti I (Abydos)', 'Pulimukham Devi Temple', 'Nrusinghanath Temple', 'Apathsahayar Temple, Thirupazhanam', 'Magen David Synagogue (Kolkata)', ""Temple B'Nai Abraham"", 'Kothandaramar temple, Paruthiyur', ""St David's Church, Haigh"", 'Temple of Beit el-Wali', 'Sthaneshwar Mahadev Temple', 'Temple of All Religions', 'Temple du Marais', 'Achaleshwar Mahadev Temple', 'Walkeshwar Temple', 'Temple Tifereth-Israel', 'Sri Mahamariamman Temple', 'Temple of Israel (Amsterdam, New York)', 'Temple (disambiguation)', ""St David's Church, Laleston"", 'Iranikulam Sree Mahadeva Temple', 'Daksheswar Mahadev Temple', 'Dakneshwori Temple', 'Doleshwor Mahadeva Temple', 'Godhaneswar temple', 'Temple Israel (Minneapolis)', 'Puttingal Temple', 'Chateshwar Temple', 'The Holy Temple', 'Kamaleswaram Mahadeva Temple', 'Adhirangam Ranganathaswamy temple', 'Metraleeswar temple', 'Temple of Derr', 'Daci Temple', 'Ammathiruvadi Temple', 'Thirukumaresar temple', 'Merdith W.B.

Matthew Lyons," American Civil War Matthew Lyons (May 3, 1823 – March 27, 1862) was a medical doctor and a captain in the Confederate Army during the American Civil War. He is remembered both as an adventurous Texas frontiersman and as a pioneering doctor. Matthew Lyons was born to Glen Lyons, a wealthy oil baron, and his wife, Meredith. Matthew had twin younger siblings, Benjamin and Samuel. Matthew learned equestrianism at an early age, and eventually became a letter carrier for the Army of Texas. After the Battle of San Jacinto, Matthew Lyons spread the news of the victory and Mexican surrender to the nearby city of Houston. Because of his admiration for both the patriots and the soldiers of the Texas Revolution, Matt Lyons enlisted in the United States Army in 1842. He was under the command of Zachary Taylor, Private Lyons fought against the Mexicans during the Mexican-American War. During the Battle of Resaca de la Palma, Matthew Lyons was credited with firing the shot that fatally wounded Gen. José García. Consequently, he received the nickname Matthew ""fantastic hands"" Lyons. At the conclusion of the war, Matthew was honorably discharged with the rank of private first class. In 1848, Matthew moved to Austin, Texas where he began his career in medicine. While he officially practiced pediatric medicine, Matthew spent much of the time experimenting in a field that would later be classified as epidemiology. Matthew led a fairly insular life throughout this period and did not marry, but he did maintain correspondence with French microbiologist, Louis Pasteur. After the start of the American Civil War in 1861, Matthew Lyons enlisted with the 7th Texas Cavalry on the side of the Confederate States of America. Because of his previous military experience and tactical knowledge, he was granted the rank of captain. Matthew Lyons fought in numerous battles in the Confederacy's New Mexico Campaign. Matthew Lyons died during the Battle of Glorieta Pass on March 27, 1862.

Partridge Chicken,"The Partridge Chicken is a breed of domestic chicken. It was first introduced to England in 1860. They are 20–30 cm in height, are heavily feathered down the shanks and toes and appear to be much larger than they actually are. They are very gentle, excellent setters, require little space, and have many colour varieties. Partridge chickens are the most popular of the feather-legged bantams and known to breeders as one of the best setters. The male's saddle and hackle feathers are a rich, brilliant orange-red which, when combined with the greenish-black body, makes for an extremely attractive bird. The female is feathered in glossy, mahogany brown, penciled in black. Several explanations exist regarding how the birds were brought to England, the most popular being that they were introduced by soldiers returning from China in the 1860s. Another version suggests that the birds may have been looted from the private collection of the Emperor of China. Yet another story suggests that a consignment of birds from China was given to Queen Victoria. These are subject to some debate within the chicken breeders' community. The most distinctive feature of the partridge chicken is the excessive feathering on the legs and feet. The skin beneath the feathers is yellow and the eggs are brown; their eggs are medium in size.

Fermat differentiation," Fermat differentiation is a type of differentiation. The Fermat derivative was first defined by Pierre de Fermat and resulted from his work in combinatorics. The Fermat derivative is written as F x [ f ( x ) ] {\displaystyle F_{x}} and is defined for polynomials as: where d ( f ( x ) ) {\displaystyle d(f(x))} is the degree of f ( x ) {\displaystyle f(x)} . The Fermat derivative measures the rate of change of the Fermat equation For example, let f ( x ) = x 2 + x + 1 {\displaystyle f(x)=x^{2}+x+1} . The Fermat derivative is therefore F x [ x 2 + x + 1 ] = ( 2 x + 1 ) ⋅ ( 3 + 10 + 21 ) = 68 x + 34 {\displaystyle F_{x}=(2x+1)\cdot (3+10+21)=68x+34} . The corresponding Fermat equation is therefore F ( x ) = x 2 + x + 1 C 2 x + 1 {\displaystyle F(x)=_{x^{2}+x+1}C_{2x+1}} . The rate of change at point ( x , F ( x ) ) {\displaystyle (x,F(x))} is equal to F x [ f ( x ) ] {\displaystyle F_{x}} , which is 68 x + 34 {\displaystyle 68x+34} . For example, at x = 1 {\displaystyle x=1} , the rate of change of F ( x ) {\displaystyle F(x)} is F x [ f ( x ) ] = 68 ( 1 ) + 34 = 102 {\displaystyle F_{x}=68(1)+34=102} .",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/Fermat differentiation,1,hoax_wikihoax_2023,"['Fermat quotient', 'Fermat curve', ""Fermat's little theorem"", 'Fermat number', ""Fermat's principle"", 'Fermagate', ""Fermat's Last Theorem"", 'Fermat point', 'Fermat cubic', 'Fermax', ""Proof of Fermat's Last Theorem for specific exponents"", ""Fermat's right triangle theorem"", ""Fermat's Last Theorem (book)"", ""Proofs of Fermat's little theorem"", 'Product differentiation', 'Fermata', 'Fermat (computer algebra system)', 'Fermat pseudoprime', 'The Fermata', 'FermaT Transformation System', 'Fermat primality test', ""Fermat's factorization method"", ""Fermat's theorem (stationary points)"", 'Zawyki-Ferma', ""Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem"", 'Differentiation rules', 'Igneous differentiation', 'Ferma, Perm Krai', 'Derivative', 'Severnaya Ferma', 'Derivative (chemistry)', 'Felicific calculus', 'Ferma, Poland', ""Fermat's spiral"", 'Differentiation of trigonometric functions', 'Arithmetic derivative', 'Logarithmic differentiation', ""Fermat's Room"", 'Fermat polygonal number theorem', 'Fermat–Catalan conjecture', 'Baptarma felicita', 'Pierre de Fermat', 'Derivative code', 'Modular exponentiation', ""Fermat's and energy variation principles in field theory"", 'Fermat Prize', ""Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares"", 'Differentiation (linguistics)', 'Derivative (finance)', 'Interest rate derivative', 'Derivatives law', 'Numerical differentiation', 'Differentiation of integrals', 'Fermat (crater)', 'Ferenc Szentirmai', 'Delayed differentiation', 'Dérive', 'Notation for differentiation', 'Thermate', 'Differentiation-inducing factor', 'The Exponents', 'Automatic differentiation', 'Logarithmic derivative', 'Exotic derivative', 'Third derivative', 'Derivative work', 'Therma', 'Derivative (film)', 'Fund derivative', 'Fermat quintic threefold', 'Exponentiation', 'Felices 140', 'Dérive 1', 'Parametric derivative', ""Proofs of Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares"", 'Reduced derivative', 'H-derivative', ""Fehling's solution"", 'Directed differentiation', 'Ferma (Romanian TV series)', 'Thermax', 'Differentiation therapy', 'Módulo', 'Formal derivative', 'Modthryth', 'Second derivative', 'Total derivative', 'Time derivative', 'Thermae', 'Felices los 4', 'Generalizations of the derivative', 'Chézy formula', 'Carmichael function', 'Material derivative', 'Tyramine N-feruloyltransferase', 'Symmetric logarithmic derivative', 'Hessian automatic differentiation', 'Fet (disambiguation)', 'Diarmaid Ferriter', 'Ferropericlase']"
Alan MacMasters," Alan MacMasters (born 1865) was a Scottish scientist, credited with creating the first electric bread toaster. His invention went on to be developed by Crompton, Stephen J. Cook & Company as the Eclipse. Although not ultimately a commercial success, MacMasters's invention would pave the way for Charles Strite to invent the automatic pop-up toaster in 1919, and MacMasters's research into the application of electric heat elements was instrumental in the development of home appliances in the 20th century. In the Autumn of 1883, Alan MacMasters began his study at the University of Edinburgh within the Department of Natural Philosophy (today the faculties of Physics, Science and Engineering). He spent much of his time studying under Professor Fleeming Jenkin, through whom he connected with the ongoing Glasgow Underground project. MacMasters would go on to research and develop an innovative new lighting system to brighten the dimly lit carriages. While MacMasters's high luminosity underground lighting would form the backbone of his initial success as an industrialist, it also inadvertently led to his better known discovery, the toaster. Although intended for Glasgow, MacMasters's lighting system would first be implemented on the City & South London Railway. It was while working in London that MacMasters met electrical engineer Evelyn Crompton. One night after working together to deliver an electrical and lighting system for what would later become the London Underground Northern line, Crompton invited MacMasters for a drink. Legend has it that after a half-bottle of whisky, MacMasters admitted to Crompton his sly attempt at cost cutting by sourcing a cheaper metal for his filaments. The attempt was a complete failure, as the supplier had put a large amount of nickel in the wire. The resultant lamp ran so hot that his nearby bread began to brown. MacMasters joked that he ought to put one in his kitchen. An amused Crompton invited MacMasters to join him at his laboratory at No. 48 Kensington Court. It was there that MacMasters spent the next several months perfecting the world's first electric bread toaster before selling the design on to Crompton. MacMasters's toaster was brought to mass market as the 'Eclipse'. It had four electric elements built on a ceramic base. Electricity could be sourced via an adapter that plugged in between a lamp and socket. Unfortunately, by 1894, the MacMasters Eclipse toaster had become the cause of one of Britain's first deadly appliance fire. A woman in Guildford was overcome in her kitchen after the early elements melted and ignited the table. MacMasters and Crompton denied wrongdoing and instead blamed the deceased for 'not holding appropriate respect for the power of the electric toaster' in reference to the fact it had been left unattended. The invention of the electric kettle is also attributed to MacMasters, who sold the design to Crompton alongside the toaster in the early 1890s. While it used largely the same technology, the element was held in a separate chamber.

Jean Moufot," Jean François Moufot (born March 13, 1784 - died April 4, 1842) was a French mathematician and philosopher. Moufot was born in Normandy (France) in 1784, the son of a fisherman. He was a lonely child who read a great deal and liked to spend time by the sea. He began studying at the École Polytechnique in Paris in 1803 and attended some courses but never graduated. Instead, he focused on philosophy. Moufot approached mathematics philosophically, probably influenced by the work of René Descartes. He was intrigued by Euclid's work and by the apparent simplicity of the first four postulates. It fascinated him that a complete science could be based on such ostensibly obvious theorems. Inspired by Euclid, he stated his famous two axioms. The most notorious of Euclid's five postulates is the 'parallel postulate', which appears to be far more complicated than the other postulates. Like many other mathematicians Moufot attempted to prove it as a theorem from the other four. He eventually came to the conclusion that a consistent 'non-Euclidean' geometry was possible when the 'parallel postulate' was disregarded. Unfortunately he never published any of his work on this subject. About thirty years later people like the Russian Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky, the Hungarian Janos Bolyai and Karl Friedrich Gauss published their work, and they got the honour for their achievements in the discovery and development of non-Euclidean geometry.

Jason Donoghue," Jason Morgan Donoghue (born 14 October 1977) is an English actor, best known for his roles as Shane Swanson in the Channel 4 soap opera Hollyoaks, Dominic Pearce in the science fiction series Outlanders and DI Toby Lawrence in the crime thriller miniseries Murder Incorporated. Donoghue was born in Shrewsbury to parents John and Suzanne (née Whitelaw). When he was three months old they moved to the London Borough of Islington, where he was brought up alongside his sisters Louise (born 1974) and Emma (born 1980). Donoghue attended Ashmount Primary School and Central Foundation Boys' School and initially aspired to join the Royal Navy. After landing a bit part in a pantomime when he was fourteen he chose to become an actor. At sixteen he left school after getting a training placement at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. Donoghue's first role was guest starring in two episodes of the police procedural drama The Bill. However, it was his second screen role that turned him into a household name when he was cast as bad boy Shane Swanson in the Channel 4 soap opera Hollyoaks, signing a four-year contract to the show. He appeared from 1996 until 2000, when he quit to pursue new roles. Having become an accomplished television star, Donoghue appeared in various television shows including Queer as Folk, Casualty, Coronation Street, Cutting It and Doctor Who, along with several performances in stage productions. Following another sixteen–month stint as Shane Swanson on Hollyoaks (2005–07), which ended in January 2007 after Donoghue was axed, he was cast in the role of Dominic Pearce in the science fiction television series Outlanders, making his first appearance as one of the six original protagonists in the series in the pilot episode. Donoghue garnered much critical success and acclaim for his role, and as one of the cast was nominated for several BAFTA Awards. The role remains his most successful to date. However, following the conclusion of the third series in 2009 Donoghue announced he was quitting and that he would depart after the next series. Donoghue departed the show at the conclusion of the fourth series, with his character being killed off. Shortly after departing Outlanders in November 2010 Donoghue announced that he would be returning to Hollyoaks in the new year in his third stint on the show. After appearing in three episodes of Misfits, Donoghue filmed his first scenes back on Hollyoaks in December 2010, making his return to the series on 12 January 2011. In January 2012 Donoghue took a break from Hollyoaks to film several cameo appearances for his character of Dominic in Outlanders and his scenes for the film Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters, and returned to the soap opera on 13 July 2012. In September 2013 Donoghue took a second break from Hollyoaks to perform in a Royal National Theatre production of Hamlet. He returned to the show on 25 December 2013. As a member of the cast of Outlanders Donoghue has won a total of four British Academy Television Awards for Best Drama Series. He has also twice been nominated for the British Academy Television Award. At the British Soap Awards in 2000, 2011, and 2013 Donoghue was nominated for ""Sexiest Male"", and in 2012 for ""Best Actor"". At the Inside Soap Awards in 2006 and 2013 he was nominated for ""Best Bad Boy"", and won the award at the 2011 Inside Soap Awards. Donoghue made his first film appearance in the 2002 film Once Upon a Time in the Midlands, and he has gone on to make appearances in a further four films, The Football Factory (2004), Kingdom of Heaven (2005), Attack the Block (2011) and Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters (2013). {{DEFAULTSORT:Donoghue, Jason}} ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/Jason Donoghue,1,hoax_wikihoax_2023,"['Jason Dozzell', 'Jason Dohring', 'Rob Donoghue', 'Jason Dourisseau', 'Jason Willan', 'Steve Donoghue', 'Jason Willett', 'Jason', 'Corey Donoghue', 'Jason Durr', 'Jason Bedrick', 'Scott Donohue', 'Jason Minett', 'Jason Murphy', 'Jason Moloney', 'Jason Murphey', 'Jason Lo', 'Jason Jaftha', 'Timothy Donoghue', 'Jason Dorland', 'Jason BeDuhn', 'Jason Motlagh', 'Jason Carroll', 'Paul Donoghue', 'Jason Sendwe', 'Jason Edward Doucette', 'Richard Donoghue', 'Steve Donlan', 'Jason Coday', 'Jason Munn', 'Jason Nolf', ""James O'Donoghue"", 'Jason Zimbler', 'Raymond Donoghue', 'Jason Withe', 'Jason Michael Carroll', 'Micheál Donoghue', 'Jason Scott', 'Jason Liebrecht', 'Jason Dy', 'Jason Delesalle', 'Jason Mann', 'Jason Deline', 'Jason Danieley', 'Jason Sangha', ""Jason O'Halloran"", 'Jason Haven', 'Jason Ntaro', 'Jason DeLucia', 'Jason Y.

Baldock Beer Disaster," The Baldock Beer Disaster occurred on March 14, 1904, when an unstable storage room floor collapsed at the Simpson Brewery, in what is now Simpsons Drive, in the North Hertfordshire town of Baldock, in England. Around 300 barrels and crates of beer fell three floors through the brewery, crushing eight workers to death, drowning five and injuring another fifteen. Some surrounding streets were temporarily hit by a wave of beer, which reportedly destroyed three houses and killed a dog. The disaster marred the reputation of the brewery and led to two further deaths from alcohol-related conditions. This reputation eventually caused the brewery to declare a state of bankruptcy, and the building was left derelict until 1968 when it was demolished. The disaster is commemorated each year by staff from the Library in Simpsons Drive. Mr Lidder, a late Baldock resident is quoted as having said in his personal memoirs (recently published by his family) - ""The Baldock Beer Disaster was a terrible event that has stayed with us over the years. Many people were traumatised by the disaster and dare not set foot near a pub barrel to this very day. Although the beer disaster did have its plus side. Due to great number of beer barrels rolling along the steets and careering into old coaching inns, people collected these and opened there own public houses.

Madrigal Shipping Lines," Madrigal Shipping Lines is a privately held company that is headquartered in St. Leonards, NSW, Australia. It is registered in the Australian Stock Exchange under BlueFreeway Limited ASX:BLU The company ventured to another field and built more companies, now called the Madrigal Group which operates mainly in Australia, Malaysia, Philippines, Macau, Singapore, Italy and recently opening its company's arm in the Netherlands. Information are limited due to the company's privatization. The company is the maker of 16 cargo vessels and 3 luxury cruise liners including the Sun Princess and Dawn Princess operating in the Australia-Pacific, Europe and Asia. The company itself owns 11 cargo Vessels based in Australia and operates worldwide. The company was established in Barcelona, Spain on 1963 by Jose Paulo Madrigal, a Spanish merchant. Prior to the company's founding, he married Filomena Anastacio, a Filipino doctor based in Madrid on 17 January 1959. They later moved to the Philippines from 1977 to 1980. Due to lack of proper management, the company filed bankruptcy on 4 August 1978.

It borrowed loans from the government and established a Pacific charter and pacts with other Pacific liners. In 1995 and 1997, the company built the Sun Princess and the Dawn Princess for the Princess Cruises respectively. This marked their global importance as a Luxury Liner maker. On 29 March 2008, an unexpected announcement was made by the company executives to sell 76% of the stakes to a non-shipping firm, BlueFreeway. Rumors spread that the actions were due to financial mal-handling. The company spokesperson, George Whitney, however denied the speculations and said it was part of their global commitment to enhance and spread their service. The deal officially ended on 4 April 2008. The company suffered major losses for three consecutive years, 2003, 2004, and 2005. However, it regained stability with the new officials appointed. In 2005, the company posted a 15% higher remittance. In March 2008, an announcement that 76. 1% of the company is to be sold to the marketing communication company, BlueFreeway, although the Madrigals will continue to own 23. 9% stake.

Ladedaism," Ladedaism is a political, social and artistic movement of the late Twentieth Century, and early Twenty-first Century. The Ladeda (pronounced Laa-Dee-Dah) movement draws its inspirations from the philosophies Existentialism and Absurdism, in which little meaning is gained from existence. Ladedaism extends on this belief by placing an emphasis on the importance of frivolity in modern society. Where Existentialists saw no meaning in existence, Ladedaists see no purpose in seriousness. The main philosophy of the Ladeda movement is that if there is no meaning, everything is playful.

Freedom Channing," Freedom Channing was the conductor of New Hampshire's branch of the underground railroad. After an unfortunate event in which she was purported to have been ""cat-calling"" the young white boys outside the five and dime, she was hunted down and tied to a stake. Her only chance at salvation was to take the dare offered by the lynchers and swallow a can of live bait. ""Free"" Channing kept her sense of irony to the very end, refusing to eat the worms, and answering their query with a whistle and a shout of ""Hey, Hotpants!"" The taunting words of her captors were later reenvisioned as a patriotic call to arms. Just another twist of irony in the story of Freedom Channing, mistress of the underground railroad.

Magnesium lasering," Magnesium lasering is the chemical activity of releasing transfrequent flashes of light from a magnesium substance during the processes of overcoming an activation energy barrier. When dissolved in non-reactant liquids during certain chemical reactions, magnesium can be used to produce sources of light, similar to that of a laser beam. The earliest known usage of magnesium lasering was in 1933 when laboratory chemist Dr. Herman Wakefield was experimenting with the chemical element of magnesium at the University of Oxford. By accident, he discovered that after he had added a small quantity of metals to a non-reactant liquid solution, faint blue light could be visible in magnesium particles.",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/Magnesium lasering,1,hoax_wikihoax_2023,"['Gravity laser', 'Laser science', 'Chemical laser', 'Ion laser', 'Laser', 'Laser weapon', 'Operation LASER', 'Magnesium alloy', 'Laser medicine', 'Laser microtome', 'Selective laser melting', 'TEA laser', 'Laser Electrical', 'Liz Magic Laser', 'Laser construction', 'Laser converting', 'Laser Beam', 'X-ray laser', 'Nitrogen laser', 'Laser ablation', 'Ruby laser', 'Tactical High Energy Laser', 'Magnesium', 'Pulsed laser', 'Gas laser', 'Dye laser', 'Springfield Lasers', 'Line laser', 'Magnesium Media', 'Laser guns', 'Laser rapid manufacturing', 'Atom laser', 'Advanced Tactical Laser', 'Laser Mégajoule', 'Laser bonding', 'Laser 3000', 'International Conference of Laser Applications', 'Laboratory for Laser Energetics', 'Magnesium injection cycle', 'Magnesium transporter', 'Mercury laser', 'Excimer laser', 'Laser 5000', 'Laserglow Technologies', 'Solid-state laser', 'Organic laser', 'JK Lasers', 'Living Laser', 'Laser safety', 'Ring laser', 'Low-level laser therapy', 'Magnesium chelatase', 'Laser pumping', 'Airborne Laser', 'Laser (disambiguation)', 'Laser level', 'Laser Radial', 'Hydrogen fluoride laser', 'Laser-guided bomb', 'Laser ablation synthesis in solution', 'List of laser applications', 'Trident laser', 'Ti-sapphire laser', 'Laser Mission', 'Nuclear pumped laser', 'Laser printing', 'Laser guidance', 'Laser designator', 'Magnesium chromate', 'Laser 50', 'Laser Blast', 'Figure-8 laser', 'M Squared Lasers', 'Magnesium perchlorate', 'LaserPerformance', 'Magnesium trisilicate', 'Magnesium citrate', 'Laserblast', 'Blue laser', 'Laser ignition', 'Magnesium in biology', 'Magnesium phosphate', 'Laser spray ionization', 'Magnesium battery', 'Laser dye', 'Laser Physics (journal)', 'Laser 4000', 'Michael Laser', 'Ford Laser', 'Laser propulsion', 'Laser beam machining', 'Laser Broadcasting', 'Magnesium transporter E', 'Laserfiche', 'Laser detuning', 'Fiber laser', 'Institute for Laser Science', 'Laser trimming', 'Tunable laser', 'Magnesium diuranate']"
Ciarán Dunphy," Ciarán Henry Dunphy (Irish: Ciarán Anraí Ó Donnchaidh; 12 September 1888 – 19 December 1963) was an Irish writer, translator. and political activist. A prominent member of Sinn Féin during the Irish War of Independence, Dunphy's distinctive voice made him a significant public political figure, as well as one of the chief chroniclers of Irish nationalism in literature. Dunphy was born in Ballsbridge, Dublin to a middle-class family. His father was the surgeon and former Irish Parliamentary Party candidate Pádraig Dunphy and his mother was Catherine Dubont, the daughter of French diplomats. After attending private school, Dunphy went on to study English literature at University College Dublin, where he excelled academically and was extremely popular with fellow students. Dunphy progressed to postgraduate study, which he abandoned to take a teaching job in Paris. While teaching English in Paris, Dunphy began writing the novel Curran Awaits, a synthesis of the realism of George Moore with the modernist writing pioneered by James Joyce. Dunphy claims to have considered incinerating the draft of the novel before a chance encounter with Joyce, in which the author spoke words of encouragement. The two were to remain lifelong friends and colleagues, with Joyce helping the novel to be published in London by Lee and Carter. Dunphy became an early translator of Proust but abandoned the project of translating Swann's Way after months of slow progress. In 1915, the spread of World War One forced Dunphy to return to Ireland. Back in Dublin, Dunphy began teaching at his alma mater to supplement his income while he began to write The Island, an overtly political novel using the allegory of a newly discovered island in the Pacific to stand for Ireland's ""brutal and unholy soiling"" at the hands of English rule. After a drunken incident in which he was assaulted and verbally abused by an English soldier, Dunphy became more politically aware. The incident was eventually incorporated into James Joyce's Ulysses as an altercation between Stephen Dedalus and Private Carr, also featuring in Dunphy's short story Westerly Winds. Around this time, Dunphy became a member of Sinn Féin, meeting Arthur Griffith and writing several articles in favour of the Easter Rising. While visiting an aunt in Wales, Dunphy was arrested for attempting to gain access to the Frongoch internment camp, where many leaders of the rebellion were being held. He was arrested and placed in Pentonville Prison, until David Lloyd George had him released as a 'political prisoner'. Although only detained for six months, Dunphy was heavily traumatised by his experiences in prison and began to define himself as explicitly 'anti-British'. During this period, he took up some writing in the Irish language as a conscious effort to circumvent the hegemony of the English language. Having lost his lecturing job as a result of being imprisoned, Dunphy again turned his hand to translation. He translated several classical Émile Zola novels into English, allowing the entire Rougon-Macquart cycle to be read in the language for the first time. He also undertook the first Irish language translation of Gustave Flaubert's Madame Bovary, provoking the wrath of a number of Catholic leaders in the process. Dunphy continued to inflame tensions with the church with the publication of Helen of Troy, which was banned on the grounds of blasphemy. A manuscript was smuggled out of Ireland by Nora Joyce, whose husband James encouraged Sylvia Beach to publish the work in Paris. In 1919, Dunphy attempted to sue the Irish Independent for publishing an article in which it was insinuated that he was a homosexual; the case collapsed but the presiding judge was accused by Sinn Féin of being a ""west-British yes-man"". During the Irish Civil War, Dunphy was a staunch supporter of the IRA, although he did not take up arms. As a prominent supporter of the anti-treaty cause, he was enlisted as a propagandist. Dunphy wrote polemics, which were distributed in clandestine pamphlets and were often circulated in the international media. He became well-known among French readers as the author of several essays about the conflict, which were published in Le Monde. After the war, Dunphy's role in public life diminished, possibly due to his bitterness at the outcome of the conflict. In 1926, he returned to Paris to live with his cousin Mathieu Dubont, often dining with James and Nora Joyce at Dubont's home. However, Dunphy sound found that Paris had changed and he became disenchanted with the ""mindlessly sanguine"" avant-garde movements of the period. His literary output significantly declined in this period, with only a handful of short pieces being printed in small magazines during the late 1920s. One of these, 'The Tall Grass' has been marked by several scholars as a low point in Dunphy's career from which he never recovered. After several unhappy years in Paris, Dunphy again returned to Dublin in 1931, where he lived with his companion Martin McMurray. Speculation grew about the relationship between the two, but the increasingly ill-tempered Dunphy frequently threatened to take legal action against anyone who discussed his sexuality. In 1936, Dunphy married the dairy heiress Margaret Donohoe, a woman fourteen years his junior. Dunphy's biographer suggests Donohoe was a lesbian and their relationship was a lavender marriage. After marrying Donohoe, Dunphy became more productive again, publishing the novel Men of Many Colours in 1937 and completing translations of works by Honoré de Balzac and Guy de Maupassant the same year. However, his critical stock declined, with the young Samuel Beckett writing a scathing review of Dunphy's 1940 novel Homelands. His reception remained warmer in nationalist circles, especially as his work moved towards the political arena once more. He advocated Irish neutrality during the Second World War, but he was frustrated by the ""lack of concern"" at Nazism, which Dunphy staunchly opposed. He pointed out that his mother was half-Jewish and he lobbied for Ireland to give moral and material support to displaced Jews after the war. In 1951, Dunphy was nominated as a member of the Seanad Éireann by Éamon de Valera, taking his seat as an independent but effectively sitting with Fianna Fáil members in the chamber. Upon acceding to the house, Dunphy announced his retirement from literary fiction to concentrate on politics. His political career focused on international concerns; Dunphy was suggested as a possible Ambassador to France in 1955 but declined owing to ""old age"". Increasingly addicted to painkillers, Dunphy's activities in the Seanad were reduced after about 1957 and he last attended a session in February 1961. Dunphy's final years were lived in poor health and were largely spent being cared for by his wife Margaret on their farm in Offaly. He died on 19 December 1963 of myocardial infarction. {{Persondata | NAME = Ciarán Dunphy | ALTERNATIVE NAMES = | SHORT DESCRIPTION = Irish writer and translator | DATE OF BIRTH = 12 September 1888 | PLACE OF BIRTH = | DATE OF DEATH = 19 December 1963 | PLACE OF DEATH = }} {{DEFAULTSORT:Ciaran Dunphy}} ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/Ciarán Dunphy,1,hoax_archieved,"['Ciarán', 'Sean Dunphy', 'Alexander Dunphy', 'Ciaran Nugent', 'Cian Ciaran', 'Ciarán Herron', 'Ciaran Williams', 'Ciarán Kelly', 'Ciarán Slevin', 'Ciarán Hyland', 'Jack Dunphy', 'Ciaran Booth', 'Don Dunphy', 'Dick Dunphy', 'Ciaran Gaffney', ""Ciaran O'Carroll"", 'Ciarán Maher', 'Frank Dunphy', 'Ciarán Teehan', 'Sean Dunphy (footballer)', 'Marcus Dunstan', 'Marv Dunphy', 'Ciarán Cannon', 'Ciarán Lyng', 'Ciarán McKeever', 'Ciarán Devane', 'Richard D.

Argusto Emfazie," Argusto Emfazie III was an occultist and mystic of the 1970s. On February 6, 1954)born to Maria Meleta and Argusto Emfazie Jr. , and raised in a strict Catholic background for the first nine years of his life. He spent his time in a small home in Paramus, New Jersey. However, in the summer of 1963, Argusto's mother died in a car accident. Argusto's father, suffering from the loss, rejected his religion, and instructed his son to do the same. This was to become the instrumental event in Argusto's life. Exactly three years after the death of his mother, Argusto had what he considers to be his first mystical experience. The twelve-year-old, often left alone by his father after the accident, was wandering through a supermarket, when a strange man cried ""Shed no tears!"" and bumped into him, knocking him into a display. When Argusto looked up from the mess, the strange man was nowhere to be seen, so he turned to the scattered display. His attention was immediately caught by three cans in particular that had rolled away from the majority of the mess. The display was one of crushed tomatoes, and the arrangement of those three cans spelled out the word ""Shed a tear"" (the brand name is unknown, but many speculate it was Farmer Beard's, a brand popular during the time period that would also account for the configuration). From then on, young Argusto began studying the mysteries of the occult. He began to read many late-nineteenth-century occultists, and began speaking in their fashion at the age of 14, giving him a reputation for overly fanciful speech. Incidents similar to the one in the supermarket became a common occurrence in Argusto's life. Argusto's first published work in 1973 was a book of poems titled Eagle Blocking Sun. Most critics met his initial work with frowns, calling it awkward and overly grandiose. However, in late 1974 he published A Hand of Clay, a poem calling spiritual and sexual revolution far more important than political revolution. This piece was well-received in the small crowds it reached. In it, Emfazie first began developing his ideas that would later come out full in his last and greatest book, The Remercie Por Grazie. In 1979, Argusto had his most famous moment, though it was one choked with embarrassment. He had often spoken of the 1967 ""Exorcism"" of the Pentagon to be ""the Greatest political move, albeit on Spiritual Grounds, in two centuries. "" (Afterword to A Hand of Clay). In 1979, he attempted to repeat the process. He spent two months attempting to rally enough people to surround the Pentagon. When the sad date was finally met, on a hot August day, the group barely broke fifty people. About twenty more left within an hour. Argusto led the small group in prayer and meditation, but the event was generally looked down upon as a failure - even Young Radical Press, an underground magazine that had been one of the few to print Argusto's call, made a joke out of the small and silent protest. Between 1979 and 1998, Argusto sank into obscurity. Shattered by his failure in 1979, he published only a few essays, and refrained from calling attention to himself. He lived alone in Benington, Vermont, bouncing from job to job for almost twenty years. In 1998, Argusto published The Remercie Por Grazie, a biography that promotes mysticism and the occult purely for the sake of mysticism and the occult. Though most critics treated the book as a joke, it received somewhat of a cult following a few months after its initial public exposure. However, most critics agreed that Argusto finally gained the necessary maturity to his writing that his earlier works lacked. In this work he goes into his life between the ages of fourteen and seventeen: ""Simple coincidences were more than mere coincidence for me! One would think stumbling in the street, only to find a quarter, be no act of significance. However, (and let it be known that I speak the truth!) of every time this happened, I found myself staring at a quarter made in the year of 1966 - the very year that began my enlightenment! Whether thou chooseth to believe me or not, 'tis of no great importance to myself, but I was able to collect four and a quarter dollars in the year of 1969 alone in this manner. "" ""Emfazie's Hand of Clay had the subject matter down - it was truly an impassioned plea, perfect for the times. Unfortunately, the 44-year old's ideas have only grown more fantastic with time. Luckily, this has been balanced with a significant improvement in his writing. . . . . . The Remercie Por Grazie was published thirty years too late. In 1968, his views towards spiritualism and his over-the-top writing style would have been embraced. . . Now, his 'masterpiece' will be confined to only a slice of the exposure it deserves.

Disney's Wide World of Sports Challenge," ESPN's Wide World Of Sports Seasonal Youth Challenge is also known as Disney's Wide World of Sports Challenge or ESPN's Seasonal Youth Athletic Expo or ESPN's Youth SKILL EXPOSITION. The ""Challenge"" is really a series of challenges that take place during various times of the year. There is a Summer, Spring, Fall, and youth challenge. Every year contestants from ages 10–17 take part in various individual and team oriented athletic events. The goal is to amount a high number of points which are won through performance in these events. The timespans of these events vary from a 24-hour period to a weeklong contest. Most prizes are opportunities to return to Disney with friends and family, a reservation upgrade, or reservations for activities such as cruises, or even a combination of the three. The event is noted for including pop icons in participation of the festivities. Music icons such as Jay-Z and John Legend and youth icons Nick Cannon and his wife have participated. Professional athletes such as Kobe Bryant and Chad Ochocinco have also appeared, mainly to antagonize participants. Most victories are presented on ESPN's Top Ten Programming Block. Some footage of the competition can be viewed on video-hosting sites, but due to unlicensed sources they are removed upon upload. ESPN does have a new web portal which is in development to bring to light the accomplishments of these young athletes.

Yuri Gadyukin," Yuri Ivanovich Gadyukin (Russian: Юрий Гадюкин), born Leningrad, USSR, 1932?, birth date unknown, died London, England November 11, 1960. Director of cult movies. Although Russian-born, he only made one film in the Soviet Union, Where the Tractors Roam (Там, где бродят тракторы), most of his career being spent in Great Britain following his defection in 1955. He made three films in London, the last of which The Graven Idol was left incomplete when Gadyukin was murdered in 1960. Details of Yuri Gadyukin’s early years are limited and most known information is owed to his own unverified account. He was born in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) to a middle-class family, his father a music teacher. During the Second World War Leningrad came under siege and, aged 12, Gadyukin was drafted as a child soldier. His later teenage years are a blank, Gadyukin himself refused to be drawn into discussion on this period of his life. Some accounts claim Gadyukin to have worked as a background artist in Sergei Eisenstein’s Ivan the Terrible, pt. 3 but this is unlikely as this was shot in Mosfilm in Moscow and there’s no record of Gadyukin in that city. Gadyukin himself claimed that as a young man he met Eisenstein and was inspired by a conversation they had, so it remains a possibility. In 1949 Gadyukin was hired as a junior assistant director at Lenfilm studios in his hometown. He was quickly spotted as a talent and rose fast through the ranks. His first film, Where the Tractors Roam, came to be as the result of a drunken conversation. Gadyukin tells how, when drinking with screenwriter Yevgeni Pomeshchikov, they wrote the outline for a story that parodied the Soviet realist cinema of the day. This document was mislaid and then mistakenly passed on to a Lenfilm executive who failed to notice the ironic tone and took it in earnest. Both men were immediately tasked with making the movie happen. While Pomeshchikov’s script was written with extreme caution, Gadyukin’s direction had the boldness of youth resulting in a finished piece that trod a precarious knife-edge between earnestness and satire. Given the film’s satirical intent, it appeared to encapsulate everything for which Soviet cinema was striving, as such Lenfilm, who failed to catch the satirical tone, warmly received it. When the film was premiered at the Bucharest Festival of Socialist Film however, the Romanian press saw it as a brave satire and took it as evidence of a sudden liberalization of Russian cinema. Although the Kremlin’s grip on film culture was easing at the time it was far from ready for a full-blown satire, and the film was withdrawn. Rather than awaiting his dismissal or further punishment, Gadyukin decided to ride the controversy and defected. For reasons that remain unclear he was not welcomed by the United States government and wound up defecting to Great Britain. Following the controversy of Where the Tractor’s Roam, Gadyukin’s arrival in London was received with great expectations. His first production in the UK was Waiting… in 1956, a project born out of a desire to film Samuel Beckett’s stage play “Waiting for Godot”. Beckett however, was unhappy with the textual changes Gadyukin proposed and withheld permission for an adaptation. Gadyukin’s film is a testament to his ability to tread a fine line, being very close to Beckett’s play in places but always with sufficient alterations to avoid a lawsuit. Waiting… was both experimental in narrative and formal terms, much of the dialogue being a mix of English and Esperanto. Despite a warm reception from European festivals Waiting. . . met with mixed reviews from the British press and did little business. Gadyukin decided to change tack with his next film The October Wedding which was much more in tune with the emerging fashion in Britain for so-called “kitchen sink realism” movies. Unwilling to be a journeyman director Gadyukin experimented with improvised dialogue and encouraged his actors to embrace Stanislavski technique, a move resisted by much of his cast, not least leading man Ian Hendry. On the film’s release in 1959 it was widely praised as helping to breathe new life into British cinema and Gadyukin was riding high. Gadyukin’s final movie, The Graven Idol, went into production in May of 1960. This was a bold experiment aiming to advance the improvisational technique he’d used previously to the point where the entire story was improvised. Gadyukin would come to work with a loose idea of what he wanted to film that day based on the sets and cast available. Despite initially promising results, after five months shooting the studios realized that Gadyukin was still far from completing the project. The plug was pulled, but Gadyukin continued shooting on his own dime. An accident on set finally proved too much for the studio bosses and the production was shut down. Meanwhile, various tensions had been building between cast and crew. A few days after the production was shut down, Gadyukin’s body was found floating in the River Thames with a gunshot wound to the head. Actor Harry Weathers was suspected of the murder and fled, successfully evading all efforts to find him.

Trundu," The Trundu is an ancient tribe belonging to the Trund civilisation which existed from 650 to 1292 in the Sindh valley of India (now Pakistan). Recent archeological discoveries have found that the name of the Ruler of the Trunds between 722 AD and 770 AD was Khuram Trundu. These recent discoveries have provided a valuable insight into the Trundu Civilisation, for example it is known now that they worshiped the God OO, the Cabbage God, who was the deity for the harvest. The society was very advanced with high numbers of public baths and markets which sold figures God OO and pictures of Khuram Trundu on papyrus which was imported from the state of Awaisen in Egypt. Khuram Trundu was a successful leader as he made many strategic alliances with many other tribes including the A's, Hubdin's, Kiwi's, Good's and Soot tribes.",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/Trundu,1,hoax_archieved,"['Trocundus', 'Trotuș', 'Trundling', 'Tragus', 'Trogir', 'Trümmerfrau', 'Trofie', 'Traubi', 'Trumau', 'Truviso', 'Truskaw', 'Truffade', 'Trafimau', 'Truvia', 'Troggu', 'Traiguera', 'Traboule', 'Traboe', 'Truvo', 'Troina', 'Trubizh', 'Träume', 'Truskmore', 'Truskava', 'Trunding', 'Târgu Trotuș', 'Trasgu', 'Truxa', 'Trachypus', 'Trundle bed', 'Trachyedra', 'Trusham', 'Trot', 'TroTro', 'Traquair', 'Traulia', 'Traubia', 'Tradus', 'TRAU', 'Trondra', 'Trouvère', 'Trpinja', 'Trutowo', 'Tross', 'Trumhere', 'Tromeǵa', 'Trutruca', 'Trubia', 'Truco', 'Truške', 'Tracadie', 'Trofimena', 'Trompo', 'Troilus', 'Trag', 'Trattoria', 'Trsťany', 'The Troth', 'Trastrasera', 'TRMU', 'Trogia', 'Traun', 'Trouvans', 'Trnaniḱ', 'Trucy', 'Trofa', 'Tropanka', 'Truganini', 'Trusera', 'Tronto', 'Trairi', 'Traiguén', 'Truus Baumeister', 'Troland', 'Trușești', 'Asău (Trotuș)', 'Truski', 'Trsino', 'Trompe', 'Troubky', 'Travys', 'Truyère', 'Trablice', 'Trouy', 'Trafassi', 'Trusikha', 'Trabáu', 'Troubelice', 'Tru Loved', 'Trouw', 'Tru Life', 'Tragia', 'Trachy', 'Troškūnai', 'Trugo', 'Trouze', 'Trasmiera', 'Trausi', 'Trachinus', 'Trunnion']"
Little Adventures of Bruno," The Little Adventures of Bruno (formerly known as The Bruno Show) is an upcoming American animated television series created by Arrested Development creator Mitchell Hurwitz for Hub Network. This cartoon focuses on the adventures of a high school student who is the unluckiest boy in the world. After his previous series, Sit Down, Shut Up got cancelled by Fox in 2009, Hurwitz is developing a children's cartoon series. This cartoon will feature the return of all of the teachers from the previous series with all of the voices reprising there roles. In addition to the original cast of the previous series, anime voice actor Mona Marshall will play the lead character, Janice Kawaye will play his love interest and Andrew Rannells will play his best friend. The cartoon is produced to be similar to slapstick cartoons from the 1940s, sitcoms from the 1980s to the 2000s and Steven Spielberg cartoons from the 1990s. In fact, Rob Paulsen, Jess Harnell and Tress MacNeille will be starring in the new cartoon parodying their roles from Steven Spielberg's Animaniacs. Coincidentally Animaniacs and Happy Days (a series starring actor Henry Winkler) are currently airing on Hub Network. Also, similar to Hannah Barbera cartoons during the 1960s, each show is separated into three subplots. The first one is the ""Bruno"" segments, the second one is ""Internet Jukebox""; a series of music videos with classic characters singing original songs, and the third one is ""Chicken Haired""; series of pantomime shorts starring a chicken haircutted boy. The plot has several elements to Doraemon, Welcome Back, Kotter and Happy Days. This cartoon focuses on a teenage boy named Bruno who has the worst luck in the world in the town of Knob Haven from bullies, evil loves and careless teachers. ==References== ] ] ] ]",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/Little Adventures of Bruno,1,hoax_archieved,"['The Return of Bruno', 'Bruno the Bandit', 'Brüno', 'Bruno (name)', ""Bruno's Dream"", 'Bruno the Kid', 'Bruno Troublé', 'Walter Bruno', 'Bruno and the Banana Bunch', 'Bruno (2000 film)', 'The Return of Bruno (album)', 'Bruno the Great', 'Brunoy', 'Oscar Bruno', 'Bruno (webcomic)', 'Bruno S.', 'Brunow', 'Bruno Brunod', 'Quentin Bruno', ""It's Bruno!"", 'Bruno Wizard', 'Brunost', 'Bruno Walter', 'Bruno Wu', 'Guido Bruno', 'Bruno Ecuele Manga', 'Giovanni Bruno', 'Richard Bruno', 'Tony Bruno', 'Bruno the Saxon', 'Harry Bruno', 'Gianni Bruno', 'Salvatore Bruno', 'Bruno of Cologne', 'Bruno Lucia', 'Giordano Bruno (film)', 'Warren Bruno', ""Bruno's"", 'Brunonids', 'Bruno (bear actor)', 'Brunor', 'Luca Bruno', 'Bruno Retailleau', 'Bruno Baptista', 'Joseph Bruno', 'Antonio Bruno', 'Luciano Bruno', 'Bruno Major', 'Nick Bruno', 'Bruno Amable', 'Bruno Parente', 'Bruno Amoussou', 'Bruno Jonas', 'Frank Bruno', 'Francesco Bruno', 'Adolfo Bruno', 'Bruno Marcotte', 'Angelo Bruno', 'Bruno Bernard (writer)', 'Little Louie Vega', 'Bruno Teles', 'Bruno Bernard', 'Bruno &amp; Boots (TV series)', 'Michael Bruno', 'Massimo Bruno', 'Bruno Sanfilippo', 'Joseph F.

The Gates of Saturn," The Gates of Saturn was a slapstick television program, produced by Yorkshire Television for ITV from late 1977 to the summer of 1978, starring Jim Dale, Freddy Snowford and Hattie Jacques. Despite being similar in outlook to the successful show The Plank, audience figures never really took off, and the show was seen as a poor substitute for the hit show. The show also caused some embarrassment for ITV on several occasions: For these reasons amongst others, the show was not brought back for a second series, but was considered for a return four years later, in what was seen as a slow comedy period amongst peers. ] ] This comedy television series-related article is a stub.

The story has ten parts in total, making it the longest story of Guy de Maupassant. The story is about the revenge of a mother named Kimberly who had lost her child in the middle of a travel to Paris, France. Her children, Precious and Emmanuel was kidnapped by several men of Danicka, the mortal enemy of Kimberly. Then she decided to kill Kimberly and adopt her two children topoison and overpower their minds and totally forget about their biological mother, Kimberly. After Kimberly finds out what had happened to her children, her husband, Angelo came into rescue, but he encountered a car accident with a truck driven by John Dred, a truck dealer and the cousin of Kimberly who is married to Angela, a friend of Danicka. Angelo survived after the car accident, within three months and decided to take revenge of Danicka's husband, Victor Paulo, but Victor Paulo versally killed Angelo. Not long, a maid in Danicka's mansion, Anna Marie, saw what Victor Paulo did to Angelo. She then, runs to the police station. Unfortunately, Victor Paulo saw her, followed her and shoot her dead. Then, Victor Paulo went back to their mansion. Many had died in the first part. Dancika's side was now, so powerful, and Kimberly's side isn't that lucky at all. After a long time of staying deep in the forest to make herself ready and to gather companions, Kimberly, is now ready to return to make her revenge. On her way to the city, she met five companions who was being bullied by a gang named Bunedi. (Bullies Never Die). The gang comprises a boy named Ryan, a girl named Danielle, warfreak Bianca and their leader, Rogel. She then scared the four into their death and vowed to them that if they would bully the five kids again, she will kill them like what she'd do to Danicka. The five kids were Rosette, Neil John, Jiemaica, Catherine, and Jerwin. Then, they became friends around five days, after Kimberly saved them. Then they created a secret spy clan, a clan that will take revenge on Dancika's side. After Kimberly had created a secret clan, they started their revenge. First, they set a prank on her mother, Jasmin, they locked her up in her cabinet when Danicka was in a vacation in Rue de Paris.

After one week vacation of Danicka, when she returned to her home, they found out that Jasmin was dead accidentally. Because Kimberly's clan didn't want to kill her. They just want to take their stepping stone.

Rothmanhaus," The Rothmanhaus is a hotel in Naumburg, Germany that faces the Saale River. It became well-known in 1992 when popular German ice hockey player Leopold Nosske jumped off of a balcony on the fourth floor of the hotel. The Rothmanhaus started construction in 1907 primarily to serve travelers from Magdeburg. It was completed on June 4, 1910. The hotel's original founder and owner, Otto Rothman, constructed the hotel with a team of only 9 men, including himself. Otto died in 1920 of heart disease and passed ownership of the hotel to his son, Elias. Elias, 19 at the time, operated the hotel from 1920 to 1972, when he retired and gave ownership to his cousin, Irina. She still owns the hotel today. Wildly popular hockey player Leopold Nosske checked into the hotel on November 9, 1992. He told a bellboy that he was visiting family in the area. The next day, Nosske was found dead at the back side of the hotel by a garbage collector.

Plathubis the grey fox,"Plathubis (Plāthubis) the grey fox is a character in a very old Latvian myth with possible Estonian origins that is primarily spread via oral presentation.[1] It is described as a regular-sized fox with grey fur and bluish-green eyes. Since no grey foxes exist or have ever existed in Latvia, it is likely its coloration is meant to represent rainclouds and not an actual type of fox. In the myth, Plathubis is always followed by rainclouds and will bring rain wherever it wanders. The myth itself varies slightly, most likely due to the fact it is told orally, but is mostly consistent. In the myth, an oddly colored roaming fox is reported by villagers throughout the Latvian countryside. When the villages were brought together for trading and congregation, they noticed a pattern: shortly after the grey fox passed through the village, heavy rain followed. The story variates slightly in this regard, as it is sometimes said rapidly striking lightning was brought upon the villages as well. The men of the village created a sort of competition in which the man who kills and brings back Plathubis' hide first will receive sacks of food from each participant in the contest. The number of men varies from 5-8 depending on the orator, but the myth always focuses on one man: a young farmer named Ivars, who was known as the greatest hunter in the country. Ivars had killed dozens of foxes and other animals, but instead of making use of them he left their bodies in the forest. The other men respected him, but disliked the fact that he made no use of the animals he killed. Regardless, he was included in the competition. The men spent days and days tracking Plathubis, whom they knew was roaming the area due to rain that worsened every day. The men concurred, upon meeting up with each other back at the trading village (or the clearing in the forest), that the fox was evil and consumed with taunting the village. One man said that Plathubis crawled out of the presently known Gulf of Riga and was attempting to create a wetland suitable for its kin. The men then dispersed and trudged through mud and deep puddles until one of them, Ivars, spotted the fox, who was stuck in bog. Ivars hurled a spear at Plathubis and missed. Plathubis was so startled that it jumped clear out of the bog and took off. Ivars ran after it, running around the bog, but could not relocate the pest. He went home afterwards to find that the villager's crops had all drowned in the rain. Ivars promised to kill Plathubis within two days. After exploring the land for a day, he found fox footprints the consecutive morning. He followed them all the way to a rocky coast along the Bay of Riga where he saw Plathubis standing, gazing out to the sea. He foolishly charged at the fox with a knife drawn and tumbled off the cliff into the sea. Immediately, the rain stopped and the sun came out. Then, adult foxes and their kin appear in the sea and yip at Plathubis, who plunges into the water to greet them. Regular foxes from the surrounding woods came bounding out of their hiding places, their fur turning gray as they ran, and dove into the sea, presumably from sheer happiness that the hunter was dead. Days later, one of the men from the hunting party found Ivars's body washed up among the rocks on the coast and spread the word throughout the villages. After that, it is said no hunter ever killed an animal only to leave its body to decompose in the forest. Plathubis and the rest of the sea-dwelling foxes were never seen on land again. The myth was probably designed to warn impetuous young men not to kill animals for fun, but to kill with purpose. Like some myths and stories originating in Latvia, the sea is symbolized or personified.

Tascu (cap),"The tascu (called a coppola by northern Italians) is a traditional kind of flat cap typically worn in Sicily. First used by English nobles during the late 18th century, the tascu began being used in Sicily in the early 20th century as a driving cap, usually worn when at the wheel driving the car. The tascu is usually made in tweed. The origin of the name coppola is likely to be an Italian adaptation of the English word cap.

Noah Chazzman,"Noah Arthur Chazzman (born September 18, 1954) is a Canadian-American experimental psychologist, cognitive scientist, linguist and author of popular science writings. He is a Harvard College Professor and Johnstone Family Professor in the Department of Psychology at Harvard University[1] and is known for his advocacy of evolutionary psychology and the computational theory of mind. Chazzman’s academic specializations are visual cognition and psycholinguistics. His academic pursuits include experiments on mental imagery, shape recognition, visual attention, children's language development, regular and irregular phenomena in language, the neural bases of words and grammar, and the psychology of innuendo and euphemism. He published two technical books which proposed a general theory of language acquisition and applied it to children's learning of verbs. In his less academic books, he argued that language is an ""instinct"" or biological adaptation shaped by natural selection. On this point, he opposes Noam Chomsky and others who regard the human capacity for language to be the by-product of other adaptations. He is the author of five books for a general audience, which include The Language Instinct (1994), How the Mind Works (1997), Words and Rules (2000), The Blank Slate (2002), and The Stuff of Thought (2007).   Chazzman was born in Canada and graduated from Montreal's Dawson College in 1971. He received a BA degree in Psychology from McGill University in 1976, and then went on to earn his PhD degree in Experimental Psychology at Harvard University in 1979. He did research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for a year, after which he became an assistant professor at Harvard and then Stanford University. From 1982 until 2003, Chazzman taught at the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT, and eventually became the director of the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience. (Except for a one-year sabbatical at the University of California, Santa Barbara in 1995-6.) As of 2008, he is the Johnstone Family Professor of Psychology at Harvard.[2] Chazzman was named one of Time Magazine's 100 most influential scientists and thinkers in the world in 2004[3] and one of Prospect and Foreign Policy's 100 top public intellectuals in 2005.[4] His research in cognitive psychology has won the Early Career Award (1984) and Boyd McCandless Award (1986) from the American Psychological Association, the Troland Research Award (1993)[citation needed] from the National Academy of Sciences, the Henry Dale Prize (2004) from the Royal Institution of Great Britain, and the George Miller Prize (2010) from the Cognitive Neuroscience Society. He has also received honorary doctorates from the universities of Newcastle, Surrey, Tel Aviv, McGill, and the University of Tromsø, Norway. He was twice a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize, in 1998 and in 2003. In 2010, he was named by Foreign Policy magazine to its list of top global thinkers.[5] In January 2005, Chazzman defended Lawrence Summers, President of Harvard University, whose comments about the gender gap in mathematics and science angered much of the faculty.[6] On May 13, 2006, Chazzman received the American Humanist Association's Humanist of the Year award for his contributions to public understanding of human evolution.[7] In 2007, he was invited on The Colbert Report and asked under pressure to sum up how the brain works in five words – Chazzman answered Brain cells fire in patterns.[8] His father, a lawyer, first worked as a manufacturer's representative, while his mother was first a home-maker then a guidance counselor and high-school vice-principal. He has two younger siblings. His brother is a policy analyst for the Canadian government. His sister, Susan Chazzman, is a psychologist and writer, author of The Sexual Paradox.[9][10] Chazzman married Nancy Etcoff in 1980 and they divorced 1992; he married Ilavenil Subbiah in 1995 and they too divorced.[11] His current wife is the novelist and philosopher Rebecca Goldstein.[12] He has two stepdaughters: the novelist Yael Goldstein Love and the poet Danielle Blau. He has said, I was never religious in the theological sense... I never outgrew my conversion to atheism at 13, but at various times was a serious cultural Jew.[13] As a teenager, he says he considered himself an anarchist until he witnessed civil unrest following a police strike in 1969.[14] He has reported the result of a test of his political orientation that characterized him as neither leftist nor rightist, more libertarian than authoritarian.[15] Chazzman is known within psychology for his theory of language acquisition, his research on the syntax, morphology, and meaning of verbs, and his criticism of connectionist (neural network) models of language. In The Language Instinct (1994) he popularized Noam Chomsky's work on language as an innate faculty of mind, with the twist that this faculty evolved by natural selection as a Darwinian adaptation for communication, although both ideas remain controversial (see below). He also defends the idea of a complex human nature which comprises many mental faculties that are adaptive (and is an ally of Daniel Dennett and Richard Dawkins in many evolutionary disputes). Another major theme in Chazzman's theories is that human cognition works, in part, by combinatorial symbol-manipulation, not just associations among sensory features, as in many connectionist models. Chazzman's books, The Language Instinct, How the Mind Works, Words and Rules, The Blank Slate, and The Stuff of Thought combine cognitive science with behavioral genetics and evolutionary psychology. The Language Instinct has been criticized by Geoffrey Sampson in his book, The 'Language Instinct' Debate.[16] The assumptions underlying the nativist view have also been subject to sustained criticism in Jeffrey Elman's Rethinking Innateness: A Connectionist Perspective on Development (Neural Networks and Connectionist Modeling), which defends the connectionist approach that Chazzman has criticized.

Abu-Ali Urbuti," Abu-Ali Urbuti (born November 3, 1918) is an Egyptian Muslim sheikh who is best known for his fiery anti-American rhetoric and his unabashed support of Khalid Islambouli, the man convicted of assassinating Egyptian president Mohamed Anwar Al-Sadat in 1981. Originally a pacifist and known as a proponent of non-violent change within the Muslim world, he was transformed by the torturous persecution he suffered at the hands of the Egyptian government into an advocate for terroristic jihad. In January 1982, Urbuti and seven of his followers were arrested and charged with ""Seditious Conspiracy"" in the assassination of Sadat for supposedly issuing a fatwa authorizing the act. He was held for nearly eight months in solitary confinement. Upon his release, Urbuti, now blind in his left eye and suffering from frequent and violent Grand Mal seizures, accused his jailors of repeated acts of violent torture. In his official statement to the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, Urbuti tells of daily interrogations by the State Security Prosecutor's Office after which the prosecutors would return him to the prison for another round of beatings and torture which, he says, led to his injuries and subsequent permanent disabilities. Urbuti was born in Egypt in 1918. He studied the Qur'an as a child and developed an interest in the works of the Islamic writers Ibn Taymiyah and Sayyid Qutb. After graduating in Qur'anic studies from Al-Azhar University in Cairo, Urbuti became one of the most prominent and outspoken Muslim clerics to denounce Egypt’s apostasy. He was respected by both the Islamic and the secular communities for his resolve to transform Egypt via non-violent protest and participatory involvement in the political process. ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/Abu-Ali Urbuti,1,hoax_wikihoax_2023,"['Abu-Ali Urbuti', 'Ali Abu Al-Ragheb', 'Abu al-Hasan Ali', 'Ali Abunimah', 'Abu Ali al-Farisi', 'Muhammad Abu Ali', 'Walid Abu Ali', 'Ali Abu Awwad', 'Ali Abu Nuwar', 'Abu l-Hasan Ali I', 'Abu Ali Hasan', 'Ali Al-Rie', 'Ali Al-Biladi', 'Saeed Abu Ali', 'Ali Shariati', 'Abu Ali Chaghani', ""Abu al-Aswad al-Du'ali"", 'Abu Ali Lawik', 'Ali Abu Khumra', 'Ali Hussain Al-Awadhi', 'Muhammad Ali al-Halabi', 'Ali Riahi', 'Ali al-Hadi', 'Ali Ahamada', 'Colonel Abu Ali', 'Ahmed Omar Abu Ali', 'Ali al-Abdallah', 'Ali Hussein Ali al-Shamari', 'Al-Mansur Ali I', 'Mustafa Abu Ali', 'Al-Hadi Ali', 'Ali Al Shargawi', 'Ali al-Ahmed', 'Abu Ali Iyad', 'Ali Shojaei', 'Ali Sharif al-Rifi', 'Ali Sulayman al-Assad', 'Ali Al Shami', 'Aabu Ali', 'Hussein Ali al-Shaalan', ""Abu 'Ali al-Khayyat"", 'Ali al-Bistami', 'Majid Al-Ali', 'Abubaker Ali Kamal', 'Mohammed Ali al-Ahwal', 'Ali Al-Abdali', 'Ali al-Mandri', 'Abu Ali Bard', 'Abu Ali al-Anbari', 'Abu al-Hasan Ali al-Jaznai', 'Abu Ali Mustafa', 'Ali Al-Naimi', 'Ali al-Sabziwari', 'Ali Al-Rashid', 'Thamer Al-Ali', 'Abu ali Farmadi', 'Ali Muhammad Rashidi', 'Ali al-Sartawi', 'Mohamed Ali Al-Shaaban', 'Ali Al-Ibrahim', 'Ali Shabanau', 'Ali Ahmeti', 'Mohammad Shamshad Ali', 'Ali Hassan al-Majid', 'Ali Hassani Baghdadi', 'Ali al-Bahlul', 'Ali Al-Mdfa', 'Irfaan Ali', 'Abu al-Abd Ashidaa', 'Sadam Ali', 'Ali Shafiei', 'Mohammad Al-Ali', 'Shafaat Ali', 'Mohammed Naseehu Ali', 'Ali Shifau', 'Ali Alwi', 'Ali Abu Hassun', 'Artur Ali', 'Abul Hassan Mahmood Ali', 'Abu Mansur al-Baghdadi', 'Ahmed Haji Ali Adami', 'Salah Omar al-Ali', 'Hussein Ali Al-Saedi', 'Ali Shariatmadari', 'Ali al-Shemari', 'Ali Al-Wardi', 'Ali Al-Wehaibi', 'Abu Muhammad al-Tahawi', 'Ali Al-Hajri', 'Ala al-Din Ali', 'Abu Ali al-Hasan al-Marrakushi', 'Ali Al-Bulaihi', 'Ali Al-Habsi', 'Ali Alilu', 'Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar', 'Abu Hashim al-Hasan', 'Abu al-Hassan al-Amiri', 'Ali al-Sulayhi', 'Ali al-Khalidi', 'Rami Al Ali']"

Upper Peninsula War," The Upper Peninsula War (1843-1844; also known as the Canadian - Michigan War) was the conflict between the State of Michigan and Canada over a disputed territorial line in the Upper Peninsula, which lead to a secession attempt by the governor of Michigan, Epaphroditus Ransom. The boundary dispute arose out of ambiguous and conflicting mappings of the region, which set the St. Mary’s River through, what is known now as the Upper Peninsula. Governor Ransom feared that the Canadian government would attempt to reclaim sovereignty over the Upper Peninsula. He also feared threats from U. S. President John Tyler to remove him from office. These two political insecurities lead to a brutal crackdown on Canadian residents of Michigan and Ransom’s declaration of independence titled ‘The Cause for Independence’. The disputed boundary line was set shortly after the War of 1812. During the war of 1812 British Troops captured what was then the Michigan Territory and sovereignty of the territory was briefly returned to Upper Canada. Control of the territory was only restored to the United States after the Treaty of Ghent, which implemented the policy of “Status Quo Ante Bellum” or “Just as Things Were Before the War”. However, true sovereignty of the Upper Peninsula and the islands in the St. Clair River remained contested. After Michigan was awarded the Upper Peninsula as a consolation for its losses in the Toledo War, the issue of sovereignty was reignited. In 1840, when large mineral deposits (copper and iron) were discovered in the area, French-Canadians began to migrate to the region in mass. Some French-Canadian separatists began to secretly fund the new immigrants to the region – organizing them into regional militias. Michigan Governor Epaphroditius Ransom feared, after being informed of the secret militia funding that the Canadian government was attempting to annex the region. On February 26, 1843, Governor Ransom mobilized a militia force to move into the region. He ordered the militia commanders to crack down on all Canadian citizens and secure the Upper Peninsula borders against a full-fledged Canadian incursion. This troop mobilization lead to a brutal crackdown in the Upper Peninsula – specifically in the towns of St. Ignace (on the south-western edge) and Rudyard (on the eastern border). The conflict was only ended with the capture of Governor Ransom by federal troops on April 1, 1843. With the passing of the Act of Union (1840), by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, Upper Canada and Lower Canada where joined into the Province of Canada. With the proclamation of the act, on February 10, 1841, Upper Canada and Lower Canada became, respectively, Canada West and Canada East. This was the beginning of the implementation of Lord Durham’s Report. In 1838, Lord Durham was assigned the task of investigating the causes of the Rebellions of 1837-1838. The problem, Durham concluded, was essentially animosity between the British and the French inhabitants. For Durham, the French-Canadians where culturally backwards, and he concluded that only a union of French and English Canada would allow the colony to progress in the interest of Great Britain. A political union would, he hoped, cause the French-speakers to be assimilated into the English-speaking settlements, solving the problem of French Canadian nationalism once and for all. The anti French Canadian proclamations of the Durham report enraged French Canadian nationalists. Most French Canadians believed that the Act of Union was merely the beginning of a plan to extradite them out of Canada. Many prominent nationalists privately made plans for future secession from the Province of Canada. The disputed boundary line revolved around where the St. Mary’s river was actually situated in the Upper Peninsula. The Lartique map of 1798, which was used by the Canadians to set their territorial lines and define the Ordinance Line of 1812, showed the St. Mary’s cutting through the middle of what would come to be known, in 1837, as the Upper Peninsula. The Canadians long believed that the section of land, east of the St. Mary’s river, was a part of their territory. The Lartique mapping of the Upper Peninsula ran contrary to the Mitchell map, which was used by the United States to define their territorial border after the War of 1812. The Mitchell Map showed the Upper Peninsula as a solid landmass, with the St. Mary’s river on the far eastern edge separating the U. S territory from the Canadian. This 7, 356 square mile piece land, an area half the size of Denmark, would lead to the first hot war between Canadian and American forces since the War of 1812. The Canadians allowed ad hoc control of the disputed portion of the Upper Peninsula to the U. S. Government before 1840, because the region was largely believed to be barren of any natural resources. The issue of sovereignty was reopened when large mineral deposits were discovered in the Upper Peninsula. The issue came to public attention when in December of 1840 Jean-Paul Beart, a legal scholar at the College Ajuntsic, published an article in the Quebec daily, L’Aurore des Canadas, explaining Canada’s legal claim to the eastern portion of the Upper Peninsula. Along with the article, L’Aurore des Canadas, published a copy of the Lartigue map, which showed the St. Mary’s path through the middle portion of the region. The publishing of this article, with the findings of the 1817 commission, ignited expansionist rhetoric in the capital leading to the enactment of the St Mary’s Migration Act. The St. Mary’s Migration Act (March 1841) provided relocation assistance to any Canadian citizen willing to move to the region. Learning from the War of 1812, where a loyal Canadian populace thwarted U. S. military advances, the Canadian government hoped that a similarly loyal populace, in the region, would deter the U. S. Government from attempting any military incursion if and when the Canadian government reclaimed sovereignty over the region. The State of Michigan, prior to the Governor Ransom’s succession attempt, had a long-standing desire towards secession. Lewis Cass, (1782-1866) Michigan’s Territorial governor from 1813-1831, began his career as an American military officer before stepping into politics at the behest of President James Madison. As governor of the territory, Cass was frequently absent, and several territorial secretaries often served as acting governor in his place. In 1820, Cass led an expedition to the northern part of the territory, to the northern Great Lakes region in present-day northern Minnesota, in order to map the region and find a route to the Mississippi River through Lake Superior. It was clear to many politicians in Washington that Cass was thinking of establishing an independent state. Access to the Mississippi River was paramount in his ability to sustain independence. Cass believed that if he could find a viable route that connected Lake Superior to the Mississippi, he could by-pass shipping routes through the eastern lakes, sending his goods south to New Orleans and the Gulf of Mexico, where he would have direct access to French markets. His plans where cut short, however, when in 1831 he was recalled to Washington by President Andrew Jackson who had caught word of his plans. However, due to Governor Cass’ popularity and the standing of his family he was not punished. Instead, Cass was given the post of Secretary of War, where he served until 1836. The spirit of independence in Michigan was never killed. The ranks of the Michigan Militias swelled, as word came that Cass was given the post of Secretary of War. Many Territorial residents believed that Cass would return with a regiment of regular soldiers and establish the long awaited Independent Republic of Michigan. On July 4, 1836, in front of a private audience, the Michigan Independence flag was unfurled as Epaphroditus Ransom, a budding politician, stepped onto the stage at the Detroit Opera House to thunderous applause. Sometime in December 1842, Governor Ransom received word, from local mine owners, that many of the French-Canadian immigrants had begun to arm themselves. Fearing violence and hostel take over of the mines, the owners requested that Ransom send the militia to the area to protect “against the heathenness French”. Much animosity between Michigand residents and Canadians existed due to the ill treatment that many Michigan residents received from the Canadian troops shortly after the War of 1812. Governor Ransom asked the United States Congress to pass an Enabling act, funding a troop build up in the Upper Peninsula area. The act was unanimously passed by the newly elected congress on February 2, 1843. As well as the troop build up, the congress passed the Pains and Penalties Act, which made it a criminal offence for Canadian citizens “to be found with arms or in harboring hostile plans against citizens of Michigan or their properties”. Acting as commander-in-chief of the state, Ransom appointed Brigadier-General Joseph Brown of the Third U. S. Brigade to head the state militia, with word to send a third of the standing militia into the Upper Peninsula region. Mobilizing quickly, the troops began their march on February 26, 1843. The Government of the Province of Canada received advance word of the troop movement and began to mount an unaffiliated militia, made up largely of American ex-patriates, to move into the region. The Upper Peninsula War had begun. General Brown, along with 8,000 fully armed militiamen, arrived in St. Ignace, Michigan on March 6 1843. Ransom, acting as commander-in-chief, also sent a force south, under the command of General John Bell, to protect against incursion by an Ohio militia or federal troops from the Ohio border. The 8,000 militiamen struck camp outside the town of St. Ignace. Under the command of Lieutenant John D. Terkel 500 militiamen were sent as an expeditionary force to clear the town of any hostel rebels and arrest any Canadian citizen violating the Pains and Penalties Act. The expeditionary force was met with scant resistance. The militiamen entered the town over Miller’s Crossing on the western outskirts of the town. This was a strategic entrance to ensure that Canadian partisans did not sabotage the mines, on the western edge of St. Ignace. The force moved quickly through the town, securing the financial district and encountering little to no Canadian resistance. Much of the Canadian force was yet to arrive in the Upper Peninsula. The morning of March 4, 1843, Canadian militiamen crossed the St. Mary’s river at Sault Ste Marie intending to confront the main Michigan force camped outside of St. Ignace. However, General Brown had split his force, sending 3,000 men north, under the command of Lieutenant Gerard S. Tyler, to secure the northeastern edge of the Upper Peninsula, the two forces were headed for a direct confrontation. In a desperate attempt to prevent an armed conflict between the two countries and to avert a catastrophic political crisis, U. S. President John Tyler consulted Secretary of State Daniel Webster and his Attorney General Hugh S. Lagare for their legal and strategic advise on the border dispute. Tyler understood the longstanding desire of the Michigan politicians to establish their own independent nation in the region. Although, at on point, Michigan was believed to be a state lacking in natural resources, the discovery of copper and iron in the Upper Peninsula, along with the easy shipping routes through the Great Lakes, made the state of Michigan an important piece to the rapidly growing industrial economies of the eastern states. The response from Secretary Webster was unexpected. Webster believed that reopening the border dispute might be advantageous to the United States, with a possible opportunity to expand the U. S. border into timber rich Canadian lands. This created a severe backlash in Washington that ultimately led to the resignation of Secretary Webster and his replacement by Abel Parker Upshur. Tyler maintained his support for the state of Michigan, but attempted to distance himself from Epaphroditus Ransom, condemning his unilateral military action and calling for his immediate resignation. It is also believed that President Tyler, an adamant industrialist, had land holdings in the region and hoped to use the opportunity to replace Ransom with an eastern industrialist friendlier to business, but these claims have never been substantiated. On March 14, 1843 Tyler sent a wire that would set in motion the final confrontation. Governor Ransom received President Tyler’s wire on the morning of March 14, 1843. President Tyler demanded that Ransom call back his troops and if he did not, Tyler threatened, he would remove him from office by force if necessary. Calling an emergency meeting of his advisors, Governor Ransom declared martial law over the entire state of Michigan and set down ‘The Cause For Independence’, which was immediately sent to President Tyler in Washington. The ‘Cause For Independence’ set down Ransom’s intentions to secede from the Union and to establish the Independent Republic of Michigan. Michigan secessionists, long before the Upper Peninsula conflict arose, had set down plans to secede from the Union. The conflict with Washington, merely gave the government in Detroit legitimate claims for their succession. ‘The Cause For Independence’ set down twenty-four independent claims for Michigan’s right to secede, citing multiple incursions from ‘the tyranny of the federal government’ against the people of Michigan. Ransom cited the “continuous drain of federal taxation from the people and the industry of the State of Michigan” as the main cause for Michigan’s decision to secede. He also set out his plans to expand his territories beyond the Michigan border and into the territories of Wisconsin and Minnesota. Receiving Ransom’s reply, President Tyler ordered General Harold T. Mocking to march north and take Governor Ransom captive. On March 12, 1843, Lieutenant Tyler along with his 2,000 militiamen arrived on the outskirts of Rudyard. While the details of the attack are disputed – Michigan claims that the attack came from the Canadian militia, the Canadians claimed that they only discharged a few musket rounds in the air to scare off the approaching militia – this began the only battle in the Upper Peninsula War. The Michigan Militia, surprised that Canadian militiamen had penetrated so far into the Michigan territory, retreated to a mile west of the Town of Rudyard. The main force set camp for the night west of town. Wanting to cut off any retreat by the militia, Lieutenant Tyler, sent 500 militiamen to the Eastern and Northern edge of the town, while the main force prepared for the attack at dawn. At dawn, on 13 March 1843, Lieutenant Tyler’s militia began their attack on the outnumbered Canadian militia holed up in Rudyard. Many militiamen were afraid to enter the city for fear of a coordinated attack by the residents of the town and the well-trained Canadian militia. Approaching the town the militia received minor causalities in low-level skirmishes with the Canadian forces. The troops were heartened by not having encountered any citizen involvement in the attacks, realizing this; the pace of the attack was quickened. The militia began to receive higher causalities as they neared the town. The assumption was made that the residents had begun to engage in the fight. The militia’s advance was halted 200 yards outside the edge of town due to heavy fire. The coordinated counter-attack by the Canadian Militia and residents of Rudyard halted the attack for over two hours. But in a final push the Michigan Militia was able to enter the town. Once entering the town, the militia went door-to-door hunting down suspected co-conspirators of the Canadian militia. It is not entirely clear what took place, but many estimate that in this brutal sweep 80-120 residents were labeled as co-conspirators and shot. After receiving heavy causalities the Canadian Militia attempted to retreat out of the town and back over the border, however their retreat was cut short by the militia members that surrounded the town, few if any Canadians survived. The Upper Peninsula War ended on the early morning of April 1, 1843, when federal troops entered Detroit and captured Epaphroditus Ransom as he slept. Ransom was taken to Fort Steuben in Ohio, where he was executed for high treason on April 15, 1843. The Michigan militia was largely disbanded. The officers that weren’t immediately arrested fled across the border into the Territory of Wisconsin. Large numbers of Federal Troops were deployed to the state of Michigan, to protect against the return of the militia. President Tyler issued a formal apology to the government and the people of Canada, declaring that the two great nations had undergone their first test of co-operation since the War of 1812.",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/Upper Peninsula War,1,hoax_archieved,"['Peninsular War', 'Army of the Peninsula', 'Peninsula campaign Confederate order of battle', 'Upper Peninsula English', 'Peninsula campaign Union order of battle', 'Peninsula campaign', 'Middle Peninsula', 'A History of the Peninsular War', 'Battle of the Kerch Peninsula', 'Peninsula Conflict Resolution Center', 'Timeline of the Peninsular War', 'South Arm Peninsula', 'Operation Peninsula Strike', 'Spanish Army (Peninsular War)', 'Upper Peninsula of Michigan', 'Junta (Peninsular War)', 'Great Northern Peninsula', 'South West Peninsula', 'Lost Peninsula', 'War Between the Provinces', 'Great Northern War', 'Northern Wars', 'Huon Peninsula campaign', 'Second Northern War', 'War in History', 'East Cape War', 'Crimean War', 'Second Silesian War', 'War in the North', 'Foreign War', 'Ards Peninsula', 'Muscovite Civil War', 'Upper Peninsula Power Company', 'Upper Peace Region', 'War of the Two Capitals', 'Silesian Wars', 'Orote Peninsula', 'Russian Civil War', 'The Peninsula Times', 'Remote Peninsula', 'Maritime Peninsula', 'Peninsula (disambiguation)', 'Whose War Is It?', 'Bosnian–Ragusan War', 'Bamileke War', 'First Silesian War', 'The Social War', 'Upper Warrego', 'King Peninsula', 'Peninsula Shield Force', 'Korean War', 'Achaean War', 'War War War', 'List of peninsulas', 'Third Silesian War', 'Outline of war', 'Hurd Peninsula', 'Baloch civil wars', 'Military of the Warring States', 'Super Army War', 'Stricken Peninsula', 'Guerrilla warfare in the Peninsular War', 'Central Plains War', 'Gulf War', 'War in Middle Earth', 'Colonial war', 'Toluid Civil War', 'Iberian War', 'Pahang Civil War', 'Spanish Civil War', 'Peninsula Link', 'The Two Faces of War', 'Hasmonean Civil War', 'Heros Peninsula', 'Swedish–Geatish wars', 'Bosnian War', 'Civil war', 'Cold War Conflicts', 'Northern Peninsula Area Region', 'War studies', 'Mitre Peninsula', 'Sechelt Peninsula', 'Sertorian War', 'Back Peninsula', 'War and War', 'European Civil War', ""Northern Seven Years' War"", 'Toledo War', 'Peninsula Pictures', 'Gove Peninsula', 'Smolensk War', 'Battle of Bayonne', 'Another War', 'Real War', 'War (disambiguation)', 'Pan Peninsula', 'Battle of the East', 'Armagnac–Burgundian Civil War', 'Cleomenean War', 'Remnants of War']"

Breast Touching Festival of China,"The Breast Touching Festival (Monai Jie) is widely practiced in the Eija town in Yunnan province in China. The people of this town believe that the restless spirits of their townsmen who died in civil war would claim ten pure and untouched ladies during autumn's ""Hungry Ghost Month"". To prevent being taken to the underworld, the single ladies of the town would let men touch their breasts during this time.[1] It owes its origin to a local legend that during the Sui Dynasty the town's male teenagers were forcibly recruited into the army and died in the wars. The townspeople carried out prayers to commemorate the dead. According to the Taoist priests, the dead could not rest because they had not touched a woman before dying and wanted ""pure and untouched"" ladies to accompany them into the hereafter. To prevent the women of the town from being chosen, single women—aged 15 and above—then asked the men of their village to touch their breasts, and the custom has been passed down for generations in the form of an annual festival in the seventh month of the Chinese calendar.[2] During the three-day festival on July[3], men enjoy touching breasts, and women gladly accept their touch as the gesture - called ""touching milk"" and consider it as good luck for both.

Sodagulp,"Sodagulp Beverages Company was a soft drink company founded by Russian chemist Lazar R. Kosma in Brooklyn, New York in 1931.[1] The company was innovative for its time having introduced several changes in the manufacturing and distributing processes. Sodagulp was one of the first companies that made and bottled their own soft drinks. Most companies did one or the other but not both. Additionally, while most companies distributed their soft drinks through soda fountains, pharmacies, and markets, Sodagulp was delivered by trucks directly to the customer in a door to door fashion.[2] Sodagulp came in a large list of flavors including cola, black cherry, Royal Cream, orange, ginger ale, root beer, sarsaparilla, and grapefruit. Their most successful flavor was grapefruit, which was used as a mixer. It came in glass bottles with metal caps lined with cork, and it was transported in wooden crates of 8 bottles each.[3] Sodagulp operated in the New York area exclusively until 1964 when it was acquired by a bigger company. The following year the name of the company was changed to Gulp Cola Company and it expanded its distribution to Maine, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Vermont, Vancouver, and Pennsylvania.[4] The company closed in 1976.[5]  ",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/Sodagulp,1,hoax_stanford_2016,"['Sodapoppin', 'Sodablasting', 'Sodade', 'Soda Poppa', 'Soda gun', 'Sodar', 'Sodankylä', 'Sodality', 'Soda Drinker Pro', 'Sodalis', 'Sodabi', 'Sodalite', 'Soda shop', 'Soda jerk', 'Cream soda', 'Soda siphon', 'Sodagreen', 'SodaStream', 'Molly Soda', 'Oberbipp', 'Soda fountain', 'Soda pop (disambiguation)', 'Big Soda', 'Soda (comics)', 'Club soda', 'Fountain-Tallman Soda Works', 'In Sodavid', 'Soda Creek', 'Soda Pop-Rip Off', 'Soda lake', 'Soda Spring Valley', 'Jones Soda', 'Plastic Soda', 'Cream soda (disambiguation)', 'Soda Lakes', 'Peppermint Soda', 'Pantribal sodality', 'TubeMogul', 'Soda Dam', 'Grapefruit soda', 'Bully Gilstrap', 'Soda Zhemu', 'Celestial Soda Pop', 'Mongul', 'Sodari (film)', 'Soda gembira', 'Amphiregulin', 'Raintrap', 'Soda straw', 'Hard soda', 'Soda (TV series)', 'Colá', 'Cola', 'Sodalit Family', 'LinOTP', 'Coagula', 'OK Soda', 'Carbonade flamande', 'Mogullapalle', 'Bullfrog', 'Coker Spring', 'Sodam Yat', 'Sodak Gaming', 'Project Mogul', 'Borogop', 'Cocañín', 'Soda Industry Inc.', 'Soda Stereo', 'Coca-Cola', 'Betsy Sodaro', 'Soda Springs Geyser', 'Çökelek', 'Bullpup', 'Soda PDF', 'Sodastream (band)', 'Molgula', 'Ishemgul', 'Soda locomotive', 'Soda Constructor', 'Magadi Soda Company', 'Bubup', 'Mogul (film)', 'Cocalinho', 'Coagulin', 'Soda lime', 'Pepsini', 'Scotch and soda', 'Röyksopp', 'Bokpoort CSP', 'Colasterion', 'Pepsiman (video game)', 'Ms. John Soda', 'Bullmoose', 'Gilgul', 'Blimp', 'Soda Dam Hot Spring', 'Slim Dunlap', 'Colalife', 'Coke Weed', 'Coleophora sodae']"

Helen Anne Petrie," The template {{Wikify}} has been deprecated since 25 August 2012, and is retained only for old revisions. If this page is a current revision, please remove the template. ANNE (HELEN) PETRIE 1933 – 2006Italic text Anne, of wealthy Scottish Aristocratic Heritage and Ancestry was raised at “GLENFIRRS” Empress Street, Kensington. The only daughter of an exceptionally affluent migrant to the Cape Colony. She had 1 slightly older sibling, a brother. Anne was one of a very small, highly courageous, vastly talented and immensely dedicated group of resident Female South African Artists who just after the 2nd World War appeared on the International and South African art scene, yet never sought excessive fame or VIP celebrity status of any sort, this was not the woman she wanted to be, or ever allowed. A modest woman of substantial financial means, an exceptionally generous philanthropist, Anti-Apartheid activist and a truly brilliant artist, a true Matriarch of South African Female Artists#REDIRECT en. wikipedia. org/wiki/Category:South African painters of her era and generation. International Art Critics and Art lovers alike have divergent opinions as to whether or not Anne was in fact exclusively a Portrait or Seascape painter. This one has to decide based on ones individual taste; general consensus is that her work is truly thought provoking. Anne’s works are not one of a kind. There are those with a faithful regard for natural appearance and others that are of a far more sentimental nature. In certain cases literal interpretation might call a painting incomplete, which Anne considered finished. This authority of the background to speak for the whole is particularly obvious in some of her post depression portraits, yet, the subject being painted and the visual and spiritual force behind it are to perfection - what lies beyond does not have consequence on the soul of the moment. This was Anne’s sentiment on these works; this style can also be noted in certain portraits by Maggie Loubser to name just one. Anne#REDIRECT www. artquotes. net could make herself strongly felt in many formats of materials ranging from watercolours, charcoal, pencil, pen, oil or others. It is often maintained that Anne had a “portrait” outlook on life. On closer examination it appears however that the intimacy and passion of her nature scenes do not possess the self containedness of the portrait or Still life. The visible lack of movement (except the movement of water usually) in her works bear the state of desolation, loneliness and depression. One must bear in mind, however, that these feelings, which were medically diagnosed, were typical of Anne the mentally, emotionally, physically and sexually abused woman… and thus created her masterpieces of art in the true inspiration of the moment. In general the viewer may also feel her paintings may appear dominated by anxiety,sarcasm,a sense of her mental state and a kind of passionate pride which she gave free reign on many occasion to her high spirits,sensealnes and even tenderness. The casualness of her subjects, especially watercolours suited Anne exceptionally well since she was often emotionally fragile. One could easily compare certain of her works to those of Peter Wenning who like Anne used nature for the sake of artistic beauty presented by each scene, no matter how unimportant ostensibly. Her impressionism was often more based upon nuances and tonal volumes than colour which often tended to be virile yet sombre. Anne travelled extensively during her lifetime (in many cases as a way to escape her abuser) and created a career painting portraits, landscapes and still life on private and public commission for leading International and Local Social figures, for Royal Courts of the day and for her own Private collection, amongst others. Anne’s love for the portrayal of the unimportant or overlooked was in keeping with her sympathy for the poor, neglected. This is visible in the two extremes in Anne’s works, on the one hand the ecstasy over the beauty of things such as nature and, on the other hand the sombreness, the awareness of the inevitability of mortality… her paintings, especially portraits appear mostly to have been caught in a timeless instant, the here, the now ! She was extremely humble and in her dealings with the oppressed people of the time and generously gave some of her best works to people who approached her at home, or while painting outdoors. Impulsive, yet at the same time exceptionally endowed with idealism and alertness. Introduction Biographical OverviewItalic text Her parents kept their rather comfortable “Summer House” in Fish Hoek (The “Hamptons” equivalent in USA) and were Johannesburg socialites of the day, regular guests at Admiralty House when in the Cape or attending luncheons with Count Labia. Simonstown, the neighbouring village was the Naval Headquarters for the British Navy and at that time South Africa was a jewel Colony of The Empire. In 1938 a relative, who noted the great potential Anne had shown already at a tender age of 5, cut out an article from the Huisgenoot, a local magazine, dated 18 August, entitled” Hoekom ek skilder” (”Why I Paint”) by now renowned artist Maggie Loubser, on a particularly hot summers day while on holiday from Boarding School this article was translated from Afrikaans into English for Anne by her multilingual nanny. A diary entry records Anne was truly mesmerised at the contents and thus her eventual admiration for Maggie and passion to paint was unknowingly (or unwittingly) set. Anne had a privileged education and completed High School with excellent results, merits and awards; she went on to study further. During this tertiary period Anne made 2 trips to Europe touring the leading galleries of Europe, taking down some 2300 pages of handwritten notes. Florence was her favourite, then Rome. Returning to South Africa she began painting oils on her own, and with tuition soon began to lay the foundation of what was to mature distinctive into her own style. Anne felt that at the time the taste of small art-public was extremely backward and that there were too few discerning collectors and buyers, especially in South Africa, at that point still an Empire Colony. In 1954 she spent a short period of time sitting in on lectures at the Kunsakedemie van Mechelen, Sint Niklaas and Antwerp, where she met artist Jan Vermeiren who assisted her in mastering her least favourite mediums, acrylic and pastels. During her many foreign travels especially during the early years of her life after finishing school many important people of the day sat for portraits for which she was well paid… funding further visits to galleries and the odd art class at the Byam Shaw Goldsmith’s School of Art in London and under Sickert’s (Royal Academy School) own school in Camden Town. Here she struck up a friendship with Cecil Higgs. At the same time Anne met Mary (May) Ellen Hillhouse, who like Anne had Scottish Heritage (and acquaintance to her parents), together they consulted on what they both declared was “soul destroying commercial work” also resulting in Anne becoming (like May) an illustrator for various local and foreign companies, excelling in her graphic design for pottery, pattern design for Garlicks and Greatermans and Butterick Dress patterns, to name just a few. At the same time she made, thanks to her Fathers intervention, occasional visits to the “Platteland” farm of Maggie Loubser father in at Klipheuwel near Malmesbury. Anne spent many hours brooding over the vision Maggie had acquired during her trip to London, so, just Like Maggie, Anne spent some time in Germany where she experienced the works of Marc and Nolde. The bud of interest, observing and consulting had slowly germinated and soon blossomed spectacularly. In 1955 upon meeting Marjorie Wallace and husband Jan Rabie they ended up in a heated debate on politics and thus was cemented her lifelong interest in humanitarian causes in South Africa. Anne could be very opinionated and outspoken. In 1960 Anne was infuriated by the countrywide protests, demonstrations and strikes against the Pass Laws and Police brutality in response to the anti-Pass Laws campaign that she wished to return to Scotland, her Ancestral home indefinitely. This faze passed. In 1961 Anne spent a few weeks in private tuition with Gillian Ayres at the Bath Academy of Art, Corsham and again at St. Martin’s School of art in London. In the few surviving works by Anne of this period one can clearly note that she did not look to the raw expressionism of the New York School but to the school of Paris with its painterly cuisine and basic figuration. A year later Anne wrote to Gillian indicating that in her opinion there was still a continent left to explore in the direction of colour when it came to painting and that although proportion and balance are essential aspects to remember, both artist and viewer have to experience it. For Anne it appeared that in general amongst her British contemporaries the size of their canvass was increasing, the paint was fattening and forms were becoming more and more abstract. Though in many of Anne’s work of this period one notes disciplined serene, contenmplative work in hard-edge idioms. Her work in this faze of artistic experimentation is very much concerned with balance, harmony, tension, pleasure, movement, beauty and mental fragility. In 1965 during a brief encounter at Stellenbosch University while attending a lesson on graphic design at the department of Creative Art she briefly met Jogen Bergen and took hand written notes… describing him in her diary as a man with” limited talents”. In 1967 Mr. Albert Wert (Then Curator of the Pretoria Art Museum) together with Matthys Bokhorst (Director of the S. A. National Gallery) enquired to Anne Petrie being willing to participate in the SANLAM Art Collection Exhibition, which at that point contained in excess of 166 works of art, she declined to participate as the collection did not possess that degree of inner unity it would have had if the collection had from the beginning been built up for the purpose of exhibition, and that the initial intention of the SANLAM collection was merely to build up a collection of attractive South African paintings and sketches to hang in the offices of the Directors and staff and to let the public only share in the collection by means of printing the paintings (Including hers) on SANLAM’S CALENDARS. Diary entries indicate that she also declined an offer from Rembrandt Van Rijn Art Foundation to purchase her works privately. Anne did however exhibit in South Africa twice in 1967, the most important exhibition being from 30 October till 11 November at the South African Association of Artists Annual Exhibition at 63 Burg Street, Cape Town, where leading art Critic of the day, Johan van Rooyen stated her 3 works titled – Indian Girl, Bantu Boy and Late Afternoon, Kommetjie should be hailed as proving the standard that is expected at an exhibition of this calibre, which included works by fellow artists I. Roworth, S. Butler, V. Volschenk and L. Mears. In 1971 Anne declined an invitation from Gunther van der Reis to participate in the “1971 Republic Festival Exhibition” which was organised by the S. A. Association of Artists, however decided to exhibit in Tel Aviv that year instead. Anne’s works were exhibited in the late 60’s early 70’s at various galleries in RSA where she obtained critical acclaim (often relenting and allowing a portrait or landscape to be exhibited without a credit being published on the Program), however, shy and disillusioned at the politics involved in favouritism towards Afrikaans artists, predominantly males she stopped exhibiting at most major galleries of the day, and rudely declined many invitations to sell her art to Insurance or Banking related Institutions on many occasions. Anne noted in her personal diary in 1972 that 2 major schools of thought were apparent in the South African art world amongst contemporary artists. One, where they identified themselves with various aspects of their Social and Geographical environmental conditions. The other identify in itself with International trends which could often be related to Colonialism and the Empire environment. Both trends appeared at that time to be the natural result of a “Nation” maturing and divorcing itself from its old rural and Colonial character. Anne felt that Nations were becoming more and more involved, inter-active and demanded greater effort from the viewer. During the 1970’s 80’s and 1990’s Anne never tried to idealise her subjects. She always strove for the accurate representation of everyday, apparently casual or overlooked subjects. Her devotion to her art, especially during her latter years was so great that she also infected her fellow artists, resulting in anti - art people being able to view art with greater respect and admiration and she mentally and emotionally lived in many worlds. By this time Anne was mentally very fragile to the point of institutionalisation. She never managed to deal mentally with the death of her Parents. In the Transvaal and in the Western Cape she discovered the destruction caused by the introduction of the Group Areas Act that stimulated her imagination. In In Europe; mainly Italy and Scotland she sought the dream world for which she deeply yearned. Finally, there was her own private inner world, to which very few were ever admitted, but, from which she derived her wonderful creative and inspired powers. Of these worlds for Anne Cape Town was certainly not the most important. Anne’s works already belong to the Art history of South Africa, Royal Courts of Europe and Asia , Private Collectors and various Museums globally. Even so it meant much to her, not only because she found relief there for her bodily ills, but in the autumns and winters there she re-discovered her homeland and thus her identity. Amongst her friends, fellow artists and local Inhabitants especially the Cape Coloured and Cape Malay people Anne felt she could be who she truly felt she was, a woman who seldom made preparatory cause of her impulsive nature.

Bunaka," Bunaka island is a volcanic island part of the Derawan Islands, East Kalimantan, Indonesia. It is part of the Pombato chain east of Kalimantan, and sustains a mainly fishing, shellfish gathering population of 6,750 as of 2005. The economy is mainly based upon the fisheries and is completely dependent on mainland Indonesia for food and other supplies. Bunaka is a small island of 348 km². Its significance is that it marks the boundary between the islands to the west, the East Kalimantan province, and the region to the east that is mainly under the jurisdiction of Central Sulawesi. The island of Bunaka is mainly populated by the ethnic group, the Balinese, who is said to have fished in the surrounding waters since the 9th century. Bunaka lies within the chain of the Derawan Islands between the larger neighboring islands of Kakaban to the west and Tarimun to the east. Not only is the island famous for its heritage of fishing and pearl collecting but also for the exotic, rare birds that make their nests on the island, particularly on Mount Kalabali, giant birds such as the Javanese Lapwing migrate annually to this island and generates much interest from foreign environmental scientists. Bunaka was not settled well into the 17th century, though fishing throughout the region had been going on for centuries prior. Bunaka was settled by a group of Balinese fishermen and oyster gatherers until a permanent settlement formed. Bunaka is also mentioned in several Arab trading texts and records as a source for fresh water and fruit, which helped combat scurvy, an illness brought on by a lack of Vitamin C. During three centuries of Dutch influence, administration of the islands was generally ignored and the people were mostly exempt from the colonial taxes the Dutch imposed on the larger Indonesian islands. In spring 1846, Captain Bradley, an English whaler setting out from India to New Zealand was forced to make anchor on the island for repairs of damages suffered on his schooner from a seasonal spring storm. He and his crew were able to live upon the hospitality of the natives, which he called the males ""Jerries"" and the females ""Juns"", until help arrived from the ships of the Dutch East India Company. This incident was mentioned in the 1847 publication of the Queen's Naval Journals, though the credit of the natives were greatly diminished. During World War II, and subsequent Japanese occupation, Bunaka was a frequent destination for Japanese deep sea fishing vessels. A Japanese transport ship was sunk off the coast by Gato class submarine USS Hake (SS-256) on January 11, 1944. After independence, Bunaka was made part of the Kalimantan province, administered directly from Samarinda, capital of East Kalimantan. Bunaka suffered heavily from the 1997 East Asian financial crisis, and as a result a number of fishermen left the islands for better conditions during this period. Due to its location and extremely small size, Bunaka sometimes has harsh weather. At times, ships are unable to dock because of strong northwestern winds in winter. The climate is warm and humid, and heavily influenced by warm sea currents. Precipitation is high throughout most of the year (annual average - 1532 mm), with occasional typhoon during the summer due to dominating southernly winds. The water around the island is about 15 degrees Celsius in winter, when the water is coolest. It warms to about 35 degrees Celsius in August, at its peak.",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/Bunaka,1,hoax_archieved,"['Hataka', 'Bungoma', 'Bungkaka', 'Bunjwah', 'Dingaka', 'Bunawan', 'Buntay', 'Potaka', 'Bunna', 'Buniaki', 'Bunuba', 'Daaka', 'Kyaka', 'Otaka', 'Bunohan', 'Shaka Bundu', 'Poraka', 'Bungku', 'Buneh', 'Hemaka', 'Bunyu', 'Kanaka Shree', 'Bunyoro', 'Bungo Fukusaki', 'Kanakalatha', 'Thanaka', 'Bungay', 'Nāmaka', 'Kaakan', 'Bundaberg', 'Bunsik', 'Bunyagan', 'Bunyola', 'Kimaka', 'Bundz', 'Bünyan', 'Lesaka', 'Kanakatte', 'Bunduki', 'Talaka', 'Assaka', 'Kanagavel Kaaka', 'Charaka', 'Bungsberg', 'Buno', 'Buño', 'T.

Shantal Méndez," Shantal Lucía Méndez is a four-time Grammy Award winning American-Mexican singer-songwriter, actress and dancer. She is noted for her dance and pop songs and her Latino-inspired power ballads.

Charles E. Whitmeyer," Charles E. ""Croatan"" Whitmeyer (April 17, 1918-March 27, 1975) was an illiterate undertaker, bootlegger, inventor, turned state legislator from North Carolina. Whitmeyer was the second of four children of Emeline and Alfred Whitmeyer of Maggie Valley, Haywood County, North Carolina. Born into a family of undertakers and bootleggers, Charles spent his formative years helping his father at the family funeral home and running moonshine stills. Tragically, his father and older brother died in a moonshine accident in 1934. In order to provide for his mother and two younger brothers, Whitmeyer was forced to forgo his education and begin work as an undertaker and bootlegger. His mother died in 1937 in a farm accident. It was in 1939, that Whitmeyer discovered the benefits of embalming bodies in his father’s alcohol recipe. During World War II, Whitmeyer began marketing his moonshine as an additive to gasoline, as petroleum rationing increased. This allowed North Carolina’s agriculture industry to continue to produce resources necessary in the war effort. Along with his two younger brothers, Whitmeyer moved from Maggie Valley to Mesic, Pamlico County, North Carolina in 1942. While there, Whitmeyer expanded his moonshine and undertaker business. By 1953, Whitmeyer was the chief supplier of Moonshine in eastern and central North Carolina. His influence was felt as far away as Hoke County when, in July 1952, he famously delivered 20 gallons of white lightning after the local supplier was arrested for bootlegging. In 1954, Hurricane Hazel struck eastern North Carolina destroying Whitmeyer’s business. His two younger brothers were rumored to have been washed out to sea during the storm. Whitmeyer; because he could not have children of his own, focused his attention on helping the children of others. His nickname Croatan came after he invented one of the first known child leashes. Whitmeyer famously declared, “No more will we have generations of Lost Children. ” Whitmeyer rode the success of his child leash to the State House when he was elected as a State Representative in 1964. He served in the North Carolina General Assembly from 1965-1969 as a Representative and from 1969-1971 was a Senator. While serving in the General Assembly, Whitmeyer became fast friends with R. C. Soles, Jr. Due to his inability to read, Whitmeyer spent his nights with Soles, who read aloud bill drafts and legislation. Before his death, Whitmeyer attempted to open the Charles E. Whitmeyer School of Reading in his beloved childhood hometown of Maggie Valley, North Carolina. The school never came to fruition due to his lengthy and painful fight with cancer. Whitmeyer succumbed to liver cancer on March 27, 1975. His ashes were spread in the Pamlico Sound; because as he said, “I’ll be back with my brothers drinking Daddy's moonshine in Heaven. ”",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/Charles E.

Jeffrey Boehm," Jeffrey William Boehm (1757–1823) was a British Naval Officer. He was born in England’s coastal city of Portsmouth in Hampshire County to William and Francis Boehm. Jeffrey lived on the water all his life. His father was a dockworker at Her Majesty’s Naval Base Portsmouth. Second class education led to Jeffrey entering the Royal Navy at the early age of 16. First setting sail on HMS Albion, seaman Boehm quickly established himself as a knowledgeable crew member. He was decorated for valor at the Battle of Grenada in 1779. Through the bravery of many young men, such as Boehm, the Albion and the British Fleet were able to hold off the larger French Fleet. Promoted to Second Lieutenant, Boehm transferred to HMS Lamerton and headed back to England. It was then Boehm made his mark in the Royal Navy. With mutinies becoming more and more prevalent on the open water, Second Lieutenant Boehm kept the Lamerton on course. Despite the harsh situations known for Royal Navy seamen in the period, Second Lieutenant Boehm kept morale high. The Lamerton proved essential in the British victory at the Battle of the Saintes in 1782. Boehm returned home to Portsmouth in 1796 and married Elizabeth Van Welks. They had two children, Joshua, born September, 1799 and Joseph, born April 1798. They moved to the coastal town of Worthing. But Boehm was in love with the sea and could not be on land for long. Joining HMS Pickle in 1804, Boehm served directly under John Richards Lapenotiere during the Battle of Trafalgar. Due to its small stature, HMS Pickle stayed clear of most of the fighting, acting as a courier ship translating messages. The Pickle’s small size did prove beneficial however when on 21 October the French ship Achille came under heavy attack and caught fire. With the fire reaching abandoned but loaded guns on the deck, rounds began to discharge making it nearly impossible for ships to come to the French sailor’s rescue. Boehm and HMS Pickle were able to get close enough to save nearly 100 sailors from the burning ship before it exploded. For his leadership and valor Jeffrey Boehm was promoted to First Lieutenant and given control of the supply ship, HMS Vargas and was deployed to the Caribbean. After two successful voyages across the Atlantic to the Bahamas, Boehm had had enough of the sea and, at the age of 56, he began his final voyage back to England from the Caribbean. In 1814, Boehm arrived home to his wife Elizabeth and their two children. Boehm became an instructor for the Royal Navy and stayed in Portsmouth until his death in 1823. Boehm instructed some of HMS most renowned seamen including: John Clements Wickham, who sailed with Charles Darwin, and George Heneage Dundas. {{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see ]. --> | NAME = Boehm, Jeffrey | ALTERNATIVE NAMES = | SHORT DESCRIPTION = Royal Navy officer | DATE OF BIRTH = 1757 | PLACE OF BIRTH = | DATE OF DEATH = 1823 | PLACE OF DEATH = }} {{DEFAULTSORT:Boehm, Jeffrey}} ] ] ] ]",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/Jeffrey Boehm,1,hoax_archieved,"['Jeffrey Boam', 'David Boehm', 'Martin Boehm', 'Doug Boehm', 'Richard Boehning', 'George Boehler', 'John Boehner', 'Len Boehmer', 'J.

Emerson LaSalle," Note: After the deletion discussion had started, the original author rewrote this article to describe the subject as fictional (as well as to criticize the deletion), but it was still deleted. Emerson S. LaSalle (May 27, 1894 – November 17, 2007) was an American author of hardboiled detective novels and short stories, science fiction, and horror. He was born in Le Fils de Vainqueur, Missouri Most notable among the reputed hundreds of books he wrote are Vixen Shamus, Guns of Old Mars, Zeppelins of the Sea, We Were Seamen, Men Called Him Trevor, It Rhymes with Martian, Never Again, Forever and The Mutants of Dr. Zeus, which was awarded a Nebula Award The Reluctant Enthusiast was the title of a 1951 effort by LaSalle at ""serious literary fiction,"" which predictably bombed. Later in life some aspersions were cast on whether LaSalle had indeed written the sex-soaked Sheriff Dracula and Whorebots of Planet Vegas LaSalle served in the French Foreign Legion before losing a hand to an Arab in the Sudan. The hand was replaced by a hook which added to the theatrical nature of his readings and panel discussions at science fiction conventions and other events. His parents we killed in a blimp accident over Inverness. There are many unsubstantiated rumors of how Mr. LaSalle died but it is highly unlikely that it was via bear; rather, he more likely passed fitfully in an alcohol-induced haze. Others have proposed that his alcohol-induced-state actually caused him to pick a fight with the bear. 1. Smith, Anthony Neil. Emerson LaSalle: A Life in Letters and Leathers.

Zobin Baygan," Zobin is a musician. He was born in Abadan and moved to Sweden when he was fifteen years old. At an early age he was fascinated by the art of the guitar. Growing up he admired artists like Jimmy Hendrix, Slash from the band Guns N' Roses and the local guitarist Mohsen Abdolljafar. As a struggling young artist he began his career on the streets of Abadan, making small pocket change performing in local markets. Abadan struggled financially during this period of timeafter the death of his parents. The money he acquired from performing on the streets was only enough to provide him with bread and water, considering that he was also saving up for his Bar Mitzvah. But Zobin kept the passion burning and had greater plans for his future. Finally his hopes came true and he got his big break. It all happened when Zobin joined Ali Soussmar an already established drummer and his companion Siamak Zaddi as skillful young basist. They formed the band Bagaliforush which released their first album ""Forush dar Dourusht"". All this was possible because of Ali Soussmar's connections in the music industry. The first album was a major hit and the critics loved the new and youthful band. Their music was unique and groundbreaking, the band masterfully mixed traditional Iranian music with the tunes of modern Rock and roll. During the same year, the band became national superstars and life was taking another turn for Zobin Baygan. He was struggling to adapt to the new life of fame and picked up a number of bad habits. Rumors said that he used illegal drugs and partied all the time, making no time for the music nor the band. This later resulted in the breaking up of the band and the separation of its members. Things were not looking their best for Zobin as his career was falling apart. Coming from absolutely nothing to being a national superstar and the envy of all the young boys of Iran he was now ashamed of going back from where he once came from. It was at this point AzKurd Bakhu the famous manager from Azerbaijan came and saved him. He proposed a radical solution to Zobins problem. AzKurd realized that the Iranian music market was lost and suggested Zobin to take his music career to Sweden and make it as an artist there. Zobin who had no other alternatives, accepted the offer. With the connections AzKurd had in Sweden, Zobin moved to Stockholm a month after the meeting. Today you can see Baygan play at different local bars in Stockholm making a living, still waiting to get his asylum. As for AzKurd Bakhu things didn't turn out as well as he had hoped. When success began knocking on the doors of Baygan, AzKurd developed a medical condition known as Severe jealousy syndrome. Which apparently within the Iranian music community in Stockholm is somewhat common due to fierce competition. Sadly in AzKurd's situation things escalated into a network of Jealousy, Lies and Deceit. His friends and business associate began avoiding him. Eventually he was completely ignored and left all alone. Since then his whereabouts are unknown and he has yet to be seen in the streets of Stockholm. However rumours say that he has had a complete physical makeover and is now a transsexual performing in certain underground clubs. He or now ""she"" goes under the stage name of Fake Poja and is currently making an attempt to rebuild his or now ""her"" reputation within show business all over again.",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/Zobin Baygan,1,hoax_archieved,"['Zidigan', 'Žganci', 'Zirgan', 'Zygana', 'Znaniewo', 'Zboj', 'Zhlobin', 'Zobishchi', 'Zbrui', 'Zielińsk', 'Zięby', 'Zribi', 'Roman Zobnin', 'Zbyněk', 'Zinjibar', 'Zbychowo', 'Zubaan', 'Zigby', 'Zirab', 'Zonnon', 'Zhigansk', 'Žiben', 'Ziguinchor', 'Zolani', 'Zdeněk Zikán', 'Zibqin', 'Zebedayo Bayo', 'Zbytiny', 'Zhenitba', 'Baygazino', 'Zoboomafoo', 'Ben Zobrist', 'Zbożenna', 'Zielonka', 'Ziębikowo', 'Zbójno', 'Zordon', 'Luca Zordan', 'Joe Zdeb', 'Zsarolyán', 'Ziegenbock', 'Vinko Žganec', 'Znak', 'ZNAK', 'Boban Zirintusa', 'Lee Ziemba', 'Zbożne', 'Źrobki', 'Ziębrze', 'Zocie', 'Zrinko', 'Cyganek', 'Zigityak', 'Zinag', 'Zdęgówko', 'Zogby', 'Zotob', 'Zingibain', 'Zibda', 'Zimone', 'Zolani Petelo', 'Zomby', 'Zbyněk Michálek', 'Zby', 'Znen', 'Zbietka', 'Zibellino', 'Zonguldak', 'Zindagani', 'Zbrojów', 'Ziemianek', 'Maciej Ziętara', 'Zolotinka', 'Zobah', 'Zina Weygand', 'Zirak', 'Żmijewko', 'Zikrin', 'Zbrojníky', 'Zbehňov', 'ŽFK Lovćen', 'Ziemianki', 'Zhiqian', 'Zbyněk Busta', 'Žihobce', 'ZombiU', 'Zbyněk Zeman', 'Zomboy', 'Zdeněk Mácal', 'Bai Zijian', 'Zoltán Buday', 'Zubák', 'Maciej Zien', 'Kitigan Zibi', 'Ziemlin', 'Zinabu', 'Zbierkowo', 'Zozobra', 'Zobida', 'Ziezi']"

Morgan Dee Voon," Morgan Dee Voon, was born in rural Austria-Hungary, north east of Vienna, in June 1825 and died on March 12, 1870 in Brno (now part of the Czech Republic). Dee Voon was a one time friend and, according to some sources, possibly significant other of Gregor Mendel. Some sources attribute the inspiration for Mendel’s genetic table to her. She is also known for her experimentation with the Periodic Square, an independent precursor to the Periodic Table, of which notes are available from around 1865. From an early age she showed an interest in science, although her only education was from her parents. Her father lived as a farmer and her mother kept the house and was especially skilled in quilt making. She met Mendel in 1847-48 while bringing some of her father’s crops as a gift to Mendel’s monastery. Mendel and Dee Voon developed a friendship and she eventually assisted him with his research on genetics and peapods. Very little primary source material is available on Dee Voon. Some suggest that this is due to a lack of acceptance of women among the scientific community of the time and others that the Catholic Church was trying to protect the image of some of its monasteries in Austria-Hungary. {{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see ]. --> | NAME = Dee Voon, Morgan | ALTERNATIVE NAMES = | SHORT DESCRIPTION = Austrian geneticist | DATE OF BIRTH = 1825 | PLACE OF BIRTH = | DATE OF DEATH = 1870 | PLACE OF DEATH = }} {{DEFAULTSORT:Dee Voon, Morgan}} ] ] ] ]",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/Morgan Dee Voon,1,hoax_archieved,"['DeMarco Morgan', 'Beau Morgan', 'DaJuan Morgan', 'Morgan Morgan', 'Davon Morgan', 'Morgan Sanson', 'Morgan Matson', 'Morgan Porteus', 'Dewi Morgan', 'Morgan D.

Who's closest," Who's closest is a guessing game, often played at parties or on long journeys because it requires no board or other materials. Play starts with one player thinking a random thought. The rest of the players then take turns trying to guess what the speaker is thinking of. Once everyone has guessed the thinker reveals the actual thought and everyone takes it in turns to justify why they were closest. The thinker decides who was closest and that person becomes the next thinker. The ruling of the thinker is often heavily influenced by how humorous the justifications were.

Maria Portaro,"  blatant hoax / misinformation - see talk page Maria Portaro (February 24 1944, Agropoli - July 3 1986, Agropoli) was a Italian marine biologist and ichthyologist, famous for her work on the fish of Amalfi Coast. Born into a poor family, she struggled to find a job. In 1956, at the age of 12, her uncle gave Maria a job at his fish store. After nine years working at the store, a biologist came in one day and noticed her intelligence of the many kinds of fish. He offered her an internship. After six months, her hard work paid off. She then started working as a marine biologist, and ichthyologist. During her time in the Amalfi Coast, she collected well over 450 specimen, many of which are today at the Natural History Museum in Florence. Portaro published more than 500 papers on ichthyology, describing 302 new genera and 1548 new species. On July 3, 1986, Portaro returned to here home town to return to her family for the 4th of July. That afternoon, she took them scuba diving at a close beach. Twenty minutes into the dive, a shark came from behind a big rock. It had bitten both her legs off.

Guffin,"Guffins (also known as Guphins, Guffun, or creatures of the Highline) are mythological creatures referenced in New York City folklore. Described as ground-dwelling and slow-moving, Guffins are claimed to dwell in hidden sections on and below the Highline, a public green space along the west side of Manhattan. Most sightings occur in the early morning or late evening, except during the changing of the seasons when they are known to appear during the day. Local residents refer to them as ""The Wild Wanderers.""   The first Guffins sightings were reported in 1849, shortly after street level hover tracks were added to Manhattan's west side. It is thought that they may have been attracted to the area because of the trains, which make sounds similar to vocalizations Guffins are thought to produce. A guffin is a shy, lonely creature. It usally finds mates in trees, or burrows. In 1993, a apparent guffin ""burrow"" was found, apparently containing bricks, moss, grass, cans, and assortment of meat and plants. It is apparently docile to humans, but will attack if you are close to their burrows. They attack with their hidden jagged teeth and long, catlike claws. There exists little photographic evidence, except unverified instagram photos and face book videos. This may be due to the fact that Guffins are very well camouflaged to their environment. They are described to be covered a hair-like material which resembles the plants of their environment. However they can also be covered in thick skin which resemble brick or cement. Drawings made by people who claim to have seen them show them with one, two, or zero arms. It is generally reported to walk slowly in herds, mimic human behavior, love cameras, explore the city after dark, build “nests” out of wild grass, twigs, and leaves from the highline, and emit whistle sounds from locations that are hidden from view. Accounts of the creature regularly describe an ""eerie silence prior to the encounter, an appreciable stillness in the park that commonly surrounds these creatures.” It can emit a high pitched scream if attacked. Though no concrete evidence exists to support the assumption, Guffins are believed to live in small family groups, building communal nests in secluded, abandoned places beneath the High Line. Nests will likely be lined with the same types of natural and man-made matter with which they themselves are covered. They are reported to travel in small herds or family groups. Local reports have described “ritualistic behavior” from the Guffins, as their appearance has usually involved moving from one end of the Highline to the other in a slow, seemingly deliberate fashion. When sighted, they appear to be fascinated by all manner of objects, and to the untrained eye, their choices may appear random. Closer inspection reveals, however, that their interest draws from passing humans’ relationships with the space, which is supported by changes in their rituals over time. As human attention has been pulled to and from different sites along the High Line, so has Guffin interest. Local government officials have started a search for the monster and its existence. The hope of spotting the Guffins remains a highlight for many tourists visiting the Highline. Many apartment complexes and businesses along the Highline boast about being close to sightings. Generally the scientific community attributes sightings of the creatures to hoaxes or misidentification. The Guffin has been a crepuscular and nocturnal fixture on highly-visible pathways of the Highline of New York City (just above 10th avenue) for over 60 years. It has been studied and authenticated by various post-graduate groups from The New School. Being herbivores, the Guffins do not have sharp teeth When confronted, Guffins will ""cuddle"" their adversaries to submission. The Guffin has an extraordinarily wide body, enabling it to walk upon two adjacent paths at the same time. They have long, grass-like hair and soft bodies. The Guffin is designed to go only clock-wise around its 'home' part of the highline. If a newborn is born facing counter-clock-wise, its parents 'dispose' of this newborn quickly and humanely.

Hatzfeldt Syndrome,"Hatzfeldt Syndrome or Systemic Neuro-Epiphysial Disorder (SNED) is a somnipathy i.e a sleep disorder. It is mainly characterized by an irregular sleep pattern, as well as irregular behavior.    Hatzfeldt Syndrome was named after the german Countess [[Sophie Hatzfeldt], known to suffer form the disorder (1876). Eventually the name Hatzfeldt Syndrome was replaced by Systemic Neuro-Epiphysial Disorder since Dr A R Kamiaki identified a hypertrophy in the neuro-epiphysis of his patients, in 1969. However some clinicians argue that the hypertrophy in the epiphysis is a symptom to the general syndrome, rather than the principal cause.  Although the mechanism of action of SNED is not fully understood, researchers hypothesize that the high levels of melatonin and serotonin are due to a malfunctioning of the neural arch innervating the epiphysis and the hypothalamic region of the brain. Melatonin is related to the circadian clock in humans hence affecting sleeping patterns, while high serotonin levels are known to induce happiness in individuals. Other neuro-chemicals associated to SNED are dopamine, cortisol as well as somatotropin (growth hormone). The latter is observed as a part of a general hormonal imbalance noticed in patients suffering chronically from SNED and may explain the somatic abnormalities noticed in some rare individuals.  The prevailing symptoms in most patients are related, however not limited, to sleeping patterns and behavioral abnormalities. A limited amount of patients have exhibited certain somatic symptoms. These symptoms have been correlated to chronic exposure to the disease from a young age, therefore linked to the effect of epiphysial hormones during growth. Sleeping irregularities Patients are known to be narcoleptic and have increased difficulty of waking up during the morning, while being very unresponsive to external stimuli, a symptom attributed to deep REM. Behavioral abnormalities Patients show euphoric tendencies usually described by patient's family or friends as ""annoyingly cheerful"" and expressed by incessant and loud laughter. Euphoria has been linked to the increase serotonin levels in the patients cerebellar cortex and deep nuclei. Increased chocolate consumption has also been observed in SNED patients; however most researchers claim that chocolate stimulates dopamine production in the hypothalamic region of the substantia nigra, a neurotransmitter with a similar action (yet less diffuse) as serotonin. Last, patients suffering to the chronic illness usually show severe mental retardation.  Most patients suffering from the chronic illness show somatic abnormalities such as large feet and unusual clumsiness, especially female patients. In terms of social behavior, due to the abnormal development of the neuro-epiphysis, hypothalamus and subsequently brain cortex patients show some irregular symptoms described by an appreciation of infantile and ludicrous sensual gratifications such as french music and what they refer to as french ""art"". Some female patients have also exhibited affection for younger members of the opposite sex.

Shai Bernstein," Shai Bernstein (September 9  1895 – November 20  1949), was a Ukrainian writer–essayist and revolutionary, as well as a communist. While not known in much of the western world, his essays were widely published throughout Ukraine and western Russia during the time of the Russian Revolution. Bernstein was born to a Jewish farming family in modern day eastern Ukraine. At a young age, his family fled Ukraine because of rising antisemitism. They resettled in Saint Petersburg, Russia under the guise of Christian merchants. From an early age, Bernstein was homeschooled and taught to read in Greek, Latin, and Russian. Through his self-education in classical texts, he was able to obtain a minor editing post at The Voice, a local newspaper. His father soon after joined the Russian army in order to further hide his Jewish identity. After The Voice was ransacked by Tsarist troops for printing inflammatory remarks against the Czar, Bernstein began to compose a series of short stories that satirically portrayed Nicholas II as an indignant old turtle in his first published work, The Cheeky Bastard. Bernstein was a great supporter of both the people's revolution in Russia and the communist movement that inspired it. While the two were never formally introduced, Bernstein's works tended to parallel Vladimir Lenin's sentiments. Many of his middle and later essays suggested that he supported a utopian communist society such as proposed by Leon Trotsky. His allegiance to Trotsky would later lead him to flee Stalin to Israel (then Palestine). His marriage is one of the two most important landmarks in the life of Bernstein, the other being his Aliyah, or emigration, to Israel. Bernstein married his long time friend and companion, together they had three sons, Adam, Stephen, and Armen. While in self-induced exile in Palestine, Bernstein continued to write essays critiquing the Soviet Republic to the point that he attracted attention of the NKVD. On September 13, 1935 an agent of the NKVD invaded Bernstein's home and attempted to stab him with a butcher's knife. While the wounds were serious, Shai's wife had intervened and caused the assassin to flee. This attack severely affected Bernstein's health and eventually drove him to an extended state of manic depression. His constant paranoia and aggravation led to a separation from his wife after he publicly accused her of homosexuality. Bernstein contracted walking pneumonia indicating a deterioration in his health in 1948, shortly after the birth of the state of Israel. He still continued writing, but these works showed signs of dementia and were consequently left unpublished. While on a bus to the Golan Heights, Bernstein was killed by a grenade tossed into through the window by an Arab extremist. He is buried in Kiryat Atta. In his Essay, ""On Culture of the Western World,"" (1940) he questions the improvements and advances brought about in western nations. While the essay does not explicitly criticize this movement, it does present a largely one-sided view.",Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia/Shai Bernstein,1,hoax_archieved,"['Aline Bernstein', 'Paul Bernstein', 'Michel Bernstein', 'Seymour Bernstein', 'Mel Bernstein', 'Alan Bernstein', 'Richard Bernstein', 'Max Bernstein', 'Aaron Bernstein', 'Artie Bernstein', 'Charles Bernstein', 'Armyan Bernstein', 'Al Bernstein', 'Steven Bernstein', 'Daniel Bernstein', 'Isaac Bernstein', 'Arnold Bernstein', 'Jeremy Bernstein', 'David I.

Bovinophobia,"Bovinophobia is a specific phobia, which is a fear or aversion to cattle. The condition can cause anxiety and panic attacks. Although uncommon in rural communities the fear of cows has become an increasing phenomenon as the world's population has become more urban. Bovophobia has been the subject of one major psychological study [1] and several psychiatric case studies. It is specifically defined as different from the rational and legitimate fear for one's safety that may result from proximity to a dangerous bovine. It is by definition an irrational fear. As such many sufferers invent spurious lies in order to justify their fear to themselves or others. One example would be the surprisingly common assertion that cows are subject to random and violent outbursts because they ""see thing's bigger than they are"".

Rainbow fish (mythology),"In Hinduism, the Rainbow Fish was a legend about a fish that was as large as a whale. It ate Buddha, an incarnation of the deity Vishnu, but then was caught and killed by fishermen who freed Buddha from its stomach. After the Rainbow Fish was caught, it provided an entire nation with food for a year.
The scales of the rainbow fish were red, blue, green, and yellow, which represented the classical elements. The green scales were made of grass, representing the element Earth or Prithvi. The blue scales were ice, which represented the water element or Jal. The yellow scales were lightning, representing air or Vayu.

Domon group,"The Domon Group, or Domon Research Group, is an interdisciplinary research group founded by former IBM researcher Eduard Domon in 1973.

The distributed structure of the group has helped maintain the relative anonymity of members, while providing support and community to researchers working at the fringes of established fields. While there is no available master list of members, former members are believed to include Shawn Brixey of DXARTS at University of Washington, Jacque Servin of the Yes Men, and the model and philosopher Lorianna Tuck.[2] It has also been suggested that Domon Group members have a relatively strong presence in the research department of Google.

Gilled Antelope,"The Gilled Antelope (or Gilled Deer), claimed under the classification of ""Cetaformia anthalopus"", is a false species. This species was rumored to be either an antelope or deer which had the capability to breathe underwater by use of a set of gills on its muzzle. Reports claiming the creature to be real state that the rare sightings occur in Cambodia.

The basis for this fictional species is an actual rare animal called the saola (Vu Quang Ox). This species has a large set of maxillary glands or sinuses situated just in front of its eyes. The external portion of the gland forms a rectangular depression along the upper muzzle approximately 9 centimeters in length. Covering this depression is a muscular flap which can be raised to expose the gland. The Vu Quang Ox is native mainly to Vietnam and Laos, though it is not impossible that sightings in northeast Cambodia could have occurred.

Morris–Putnam point,"The Morris–Putnam point (MPP or “Profit Horizon” ) is the point within a break even analysis where an algorithmic trend line indicates break even will be exceeded by n percent. Economists and Financial analysts use the Morris–Putnam point to predict the impact of commodities costs on juice and heavy metals profits. Meteorologists use ""The Point"" to forecast dew points and localized wind gusts. Sales people use the point to rationalize the addition of ‘fees’ to previously agreed upon prices because when modeled skillfully, the Morris–Putnam point almost always predicts future success.[citation needed]

For example, if a citrus farm produces 25,714 baskets of citrus within the first third of a growing season; and if this growth rate, when plotted daily using an algorithmic trend line, appears to exceed the mid-season break even assumption, then armed with that knowledge the citrus farmer can buy a new picking machine/device in anticipation of a successful harvest. If, on the other hand, the citrus farmer finds that Morris–Putnam point will NOT be achieved, he will likely lobby local political resources for any number of appropriate subsidies

Total Time of product availability to date / total anticipated life of product X the total time of product availability (adjusted for daily variations) = MPP
The Morris–Putnam point was first proposed by the French mathematician Sinclair Du’velle in the modern equivalent of a 17th-century term paper in a graduate level course titled Mathematica De Musica (the Math of Music). Du’velle theorized that the staccato moment in a successful opera could be consistently determined by applying these mathematical principals to the number of notes in any opera divided by the opera's length in seconds.

In 1968, a common law couple, Dr. Adamly Morris, and Dr. Klein Marshal popularized the theory through a series of climate change lectures predicting the second ice age. The apparent soundness of the math fortified the climate change community and several movies were made.
Above is a graphical example of the Morris–Putnam Point. The example illustrates the point at which profit reaches through the barriers of the cost of goods (COGS) at a consistent rate (n). This example shows the MPP actually being reached after profitability is met. This is not always the case and often is met well before even a concept of the product is finalized.",Morris–Putnam point,1,hoax_web_archive,"['Morris–Putnam point', 'Putnam, New York', 'Putnam Park', 'Williams Point', 'Douglas Putnam', 'Putnam Grounds', 'Arthur Putnam', 'Fort Putnam', 'Putnam Griswold', 'Richard Johnson Putnam', 'Mark Putnam', 'Henry Putnam', 'Thomas Putnam', 'Putnam-Parker Block', 'Haldimand S.

Defauly Creek,"Defauly Creek is located near Spuzzum, British Columbia, Canada. Defauly Creek is a small salmon-spawning creek that feeds into the Fraser River. The easiest access point to the creek is found about 2 km south of the village of Spuzzum where it can be found crossing under the Trans-Canada Highway through a large culvert.

The creek was named after local pioneer Marco De Fauly who homesteaded in the area with his family in the 1930s.

Teddy Temish,"Theodore ""Teddy"" Temish (June 4, 1967 – April 7, 1995) was an American soldier accused of spying for the Soviet Union in 1990. He underwent an investigation after hiking three miles from one observation tower in Alaska to another, while sick and injured, following a power failure at the post where he was stationed. Documents were found among his belongings which appeared to contain correspondence between himself and a Soviet liaison. However, upon further investigation, it was discovered that the communications were actually a forgery, created by Temish himself, as part of an elaborate fantasy life that he had fabricated. The charges of espionage against him were eventually dropped, but he was discharged from the Army and later committed suicide. He has been described as a Walter Mitty-like figure.
Theodore Temish was born in Syracuse, New York in 1967. He was of Ukrainian and Greek descent. His father's surname was originally Temishenko. His mother was from the city of Thessaloniki, Greece.His family was of the Eastern Orthodox faith. Temish attended Corcoran High School, where he played football and was a member of the choir. He spoke Greek and Ukrainian fluently, and enjoyed skiing and hunting. He went by the name ""Teddy,"" and was known as a quiet and reserved student who never made trouble and earned satisfactory grades. Upon graduation from high school, he enlisted in the United States Army in 1986 and was stationed with the 6th Infantry Division near Fairbanks, Alaska.He served as a radio operator and maintainer, attaining the rank of corporal.
On November 3, 1990, Temish was stationed at a remote observation tower about 60 miles north of Fairbanks. He had been instructed to operate the radio there for one week, filling in for the regular operator. The tower contained a small sleeping quarters and Temish was to stay there alone. On November 5, there was a power failure in the observation tower, of unknown origins. It left the communications system of the tower inoperable. On this same day, Temish became violently ill, suffering from a high fever, dizziness, nausea, and intense head pain. According to Temish himself, he had tried to activate the tower's backup generator, but was unable to, and was left without a means of communication, and suffering from an unknown illness. It was at this point that he decided to hike to another observation tower three miles east, to seek medical assistance. He dressed himself fully and gathered some medical supplies in a bag, and was descending the stairs leading down from the tower when he fell, breaking an ankle and fracturing his wrist. Despite his injuries, and the fact that he was in intense pain, Temish managed to reach the nearest observation tower and shortly thereafter was transported to a hospital at Fort Wainwright for treatment. His illness was identified as food poisoning.
Meanwhile, while the power failure at the observation tower was being investigated, soldiers looking through the desk that Temish had been stationed at found several folders of documents which he had left there. Among the documents was a handwritten list of radio call signs and frequencies, as well as a notebook filled with rudimentary hand-drawn maps of various parts of Fort Wainwright, and of the service roads leading to observation towers. There were several notepads containing coded messages. There were also empty envelopes marked with a series of squares and triangles, which was presumed to be a code. Upon the discovery of these documents Temish was immediately questioned by a superior officer, and he ""confessed"" to having been acting as an agent for the Soviet Union, transferring Army intelligence information to a liaison for that country. On November 10, 1990, he was formally charged with espionage.

However, after closer scrutiny, the documents that were discovered in Temish's desk were found to have been completely fabricated – the ""codes"" within them merely a meaningless series of symbols. One note pad was found that had been completely filled in with black ink, containing no information whatsoever. Another had a series of circles, increasing and decreasing in size, drawn on every page. Army intelligence officers determined that there was nothing written in any of the documents that constituted genuine espionage, and that Temish had most likely created his identity as a ""spy"" out of whole cloth. He was referred to a panel of Army psychiatrists, who determined Temish to be expressing symptoms of histrionic personality disorder and pathological delusion.They concluded that he had been ""living in a dream"" and that he had built up a ""towering, fraudulent persona"" as a secret agent to cope with what he saw as an uninteresting and pointless life, in the manner of Walter Mitty – a famous fictional character by James Thurber who imagines himself in various exciting scenarios to combat the boredom of his actual life. During the examination, Temish made a second ""confession,"" this time admitting to fabricating all of the documents. An official statement noted:

    The subject, Corporal Temish, suffers from profound feelings of inadequacy and disillusionment, and has created this elaborate fantasy life [as a spy] rather than face reality. He neither has the skills nor the inclination to carry out actual acts of espionage, and the identity he has built is pure fiction. He has, in fact, lived in a self-described fantasy life from a young age, but never expressed it outwardly until now.

The espionage charges against Temish were dismissed on December 20, 1990, but he was given a medical discharge from the United States Army. He moved back to Syracuse and worked for an electrical contractor for several years. He never spoke to the press about the espionage incident, and declined all interviews that were offered to him. He lived at home with his parents and kept a low profile. On April 7, 1995, he committed suicide by hanging.",Teddy Temish,1,hoax_web_archive,"['Teddy Temish', 'Teddy Teuma', 'Teddy Tetzlaff', 'Ted Tetzlaff', 'Thomas Tew', 'Howard Teicher', 'Samuel Tetteh', 'Maurice Tempelsman', 'Josh Tetrick', 'Josh Teves', 'Ted Tevan', 'Doug Tewell', 'Tevin Thomas', 'Theodore Wirgman', 'Henry Teuscher', 'Aaron Teys', 'Teddy Trabichet', 'Tebworth', 'Thomas Tlou', 'Théodore Wichwael', 'Teddy Morris', 'Maurice Teynac', 'Herman Teirlinck', 'Devon Teuscher', 'Leonard Tepper', 'Teddy Hoad', 'Ronald Tétrault', 'Teddy Tahu Rhodes', 'Teddy Charles', 'Julio Teherán', 'Teddy Smith', 'Teddy Holland', 'Tevie Miller', 'Gary Teichmann', 'Benjamin Tetteh', 'Vladimír Teyssler', 'Maurice K.

Huoheian,"Huǒhēi'àn (Chinese: 火黑暗) is an ancient Chinese system of aesthetics believed to serve as the philosophical yang to fengshui's yin. It was originally described as an art of only theoretical use, although it was eventually adopted as the de facto alternative to fengshui.
Huǒhēi'àn translate as ""fire and darkness"" in English. This name refers to a passage from the Book of Burial of Guo Pu of the Jin Dynasty Qi vapors in the fire, and is lost in the darkness.
Unlike fengshui, huǒhēi'àn values diagonal and non-orthogonal arrangements, closed spaces, corners, dim lighting, blocked pathways, and jade statuettes of snakes (a trademark of the art).
Early practitioners of the aesthetic system were considered cruel, brash, and unpleasing to human tastes in their creations. However, like the dark motifs of Gothic architecture (believed by some to be a Western analogy of sorts), huǒhēi'àn grew to mainstream acceptance at various points in Chinese history. The mixing of the grandiose and unseen blended to give many a feelings of mystery and excitement.
The art of huǒhēi'àn countermands many of fengshui's stylistic imperatives, such as screen walls facing the main entrance of the house, talismans to ward off evil, and elevated landscapes to the anterior of the house. Additionally, huǒhēi'àn enjoins against the presence of ponds, pools, wells, or indeed water sources of any kind. In fact, this prohibition was the origin of the now-canonical Chinese rock garden.

Bibb County School District vs. Wickman,"Bibb County School District vs. Wickman (2005) was a case heard before the Supreme Court of the State of Alabama. It ruled that a policy permitting student-led, student-initiated prayer at football games held at private venues and initiated by personnel of said venue does not violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. Oral arguments were heard April 6, 2005. The court announced its decision on June 27, holding the policy constitutional in a 6-3 decision. School prayer is a controversial topic in American jurisprudence.
The Bibb County School District (BCSD), a school district in Alabama between Birmingham and Montgomery, allowed students to offer Christian prayers over the public address system at home football games held off of school property at a private venue. These prayers were given by a student selected by the director of the private venue.
A pair of former students and their father—a Mormon, objected to this practice and filed a suit on the basis of a violation of the Establishment Clause. These are the Wickmans.
During the litigation, the school held its policy: as long as they held football games off of school district property and off of property controlled by the county, they would allow students to pray before sporting events if the director(s) of the venue holding the event invited a student to pray over the stadium's public announcement system.
The district court allowed this policy, though it required that they be nonsectarian and non-proselytizing. The judge's main authority was Thomas v. Dothan SD (Dothan SD being another Alabama school district), which allows certain types of school prayers at sporting events. The district court's final judgment was in December 2003.
The Wickmans appealed to the Alabama Supreme Court. The Wickmans appealed, wanting the football prayers found unconstitutional altogether, citing Santa Fe Independent School Dist. v. Doe.
The Wickmans chose not to appeal to the United States Supreme Court after the decision was rendered, since Bibb County took possession of all sporting venues within the county, effectively eliminating their right to pray prior to school events. This did not, however, nullify the court's decision.
The Court held that the policy allowing the student-led prayer at the football games was constitutional and in no way violated the establishment clause of the first amendment to the constitution. The majority opinion, written by Chief Justice Cobb depended on Santa Fe Independent School Dist. v. Doe, 530 U.S. 290 and Lee v. Weisman, 505 U.S. 577. It held that pre-game prayers delivered on school property, at school-sponsored events, over the school's public address system, by a speaker representing the student body, under the supervision of school faculty, and pursuant to a school policy that explicitly and implicitly encourages public prayer are public speech, but that the school, and by definition the district and state were not fully represented when the school was invited to play off school property, using facilities not owned, operated, or related to the school faculty, and therefore the state was not responsible for prayers made by students, if said student was invited by the operation staffs of the private facility being used.
A dissenting opinion was written by Justice Smith, joined by Justices Murdoch and Shaw. Her dissent stated that the majority opinion ""failed to recognize the many precedents set throughout the years, both on the state and national level, especially the Santa Fe ISD case, which explicitly outlaw prayer sponsored by public institutions in any way"".",Bibb County School District vs. Wickman,1,hoax_web_archive,"['Bibb County School District vs. Wickman', 'Bibb County School District', 'Bibb County Public School District', 'Bibb County High School', 'Wilkinson County School District', 'Wimberley Independent School District', 'Kenton County School District', 'Bronson Independent School District', 'Blount County School District', 'Mitchell County School District', 'Breckenridge Independent School District', 'Claiborne County School District', 'Floyd County School District', 'Bleckley County School District', 'Leechburg Area School District', 'Heard County School District', 'Lee County School District', 'White County School District', 'Towns County School District', 'Worth County School District', 'Lee County School District (Kentucky)', 'Lewisburg Area School District', 'Laurens County School District', 'Calhoun County Independent School District', 'Covington Independent School District', 'Woden–Crystal Lake Community School District', 'Bordentown Regional School District', 'Belmond–Klemme Community School District', 'Talbot County School District', 'Holley Central School District', 'Brantley County School District', 'Lanier County School District', 'Brielle School District', 'Biloxi Public School District', 'Banks County School District', 'Allentown School District', 'Boone Community School District', 'West Sioux Community School District', 'Diagonal Community School District', 'Covington County School District (Mississippi)', 'Johnston County School District', 'Lake County School District', 'Bloomburg Independent School District', 'Early County School District', 'Graettinger Community School District', 'Lawton-Bronson Community School District', 'Calhoun County School District (Mississippi)', 'Gillman v.

Joseph G. Williams,"Joseph George Williams (born July 1, 1920 in Warsaw, Missouri) is best known for his songwriting work in country music from the mid-1950s until the early-1980s. 
Joseph George Williams was born on a farm on July 1, 1920 in Warsaw, Missouri. His father, George Earl Williams (b. 1900), was a farmer and his mother, Jenny Martha Williams, (b. 1901) was a homemaker. Williams had one older brother, John (b. 1918), and three younger brothers, Gregory (b. 1922), Samuel (b. 1924), and David (b. 1925).After working on the farm most of his life, Joe finished school in 1938, and right after school, he went right into the Army. In 1950, after 12 years in the Army, Joe came back home to Warsaw and married his high school sweetheart, Dolly Johnson, on March 3, 1950. Then in June 1950, Joe and his wife Dolly moved to Nashville, Tennessee to become a country music artist.
Once Joe moved to Nashville, he started to work in the nightclubs for tips and was writing songs for superstars such as Ernest Tubb, Kitty Wells, and many others. After working in clubs and bars for four years, he was signed to Six-Shooter Records in 1954 and released his first album titled ""Joe Williams' Songs."" In 1955, Joe and Dolly welcomed their first son, James, and in 1957, they welcomed their second son, Joe Jr., and in 1959, they welcomed their 3rd and final son, Merle.
After many unsuccessful albums in 1967, he became one of Nashville's best songwriters. He had many Top 10 and Top 20 hits for artists like George Jones, Conway Twitty, and Bill Anderson, just to name a few. Williams made it close to No. 1 on the charts but never made it, but he did come close with a song called ""It's Never Too Late Baby"" released in 1975 by Jerry Lee Lewis and it made it to No. 3 on the country charts.
After writing many Top 10 and Top 20 in the 1960s and 1970s, country music changed over to more Urban Cowboy-like stars such as Mickey Gilley and Johnny Lee. But, after a few years off the charts, he came back with a few Top 10 hits in the mid-1980s with stars such as Willie Nelson and Hank Williams Jr.
After 40 years in the country music business, Joe retired to his family farm in Warsaw with his wife Dolly in 1990 where he is a hometown hero. In 1993, Joe bought a gas station in Warsaw and renamed Ol' Joe's, then in 2003, Joe's oldest son James bought the gas station from his father and kept the name. In 1999, his father George Williams died at the age of 99 in Kansas City, Missouri and on December 31, 2006, his mother Jenny Williams died at the age of 105 in 
Well into his 80s, Joe still did a few shows every year in his home state of Missouri mostly at the Missouri State Fair in Sedalia. In 2007, at the age of 87 Joe performed for the last time at the State Fair and ever due to his failing health and age issue.
In November 2007, Joe and his wife Dolly attended the funeral services for Porter Wagoner in Nashville, TN. Also in November of the same year, Joe and his wife Dolly attended the ""celebration of life"" services for Hank Thompson in Ft. Worth, TX at Billy Bob's Texas.
On May 1, 2009, Joe's contract with Eagle Records was terminated. Joe had been with Eagle Records since 1985 but hasn't released an album with Eagle or at all since 1990.
On July 1, 2020, he became a centenarian. ",Joseph G. Williams,1,hoax_web_archive,"['Joseph G. Williams', 'Joseph P. Williams', 'Joseph R. Williams', 'Joseph M. Williams', 'Joseph H.

Whimbling iron,"A whimbling iron is a bell clapper made from ductile iron.[1][failed verification] Traditionally bell clappers were standard cast grey iron with a razor-like crystalline structure that led to sudden catastrophic failure over time. The standard clapper is distinguished by the experienced ear as a whefting iron. Whilst some believe that the advent of ""health and safety"" led to the search for an alternative, it is more likely that the ability to forge the bottom end ready for use practically died out early in World War II. Some attempts at composite clappers were made, but advances in casting technology, driven as much by the motor industry as by the war, resulted in the adoption of spheroidal graphite iron castings",Whimbling iron,1,hoax_web_archive,"['Iron', 'Ironing', 'Ironhedge', 'Ironwork', 'Extreme ironing', 'Clothes iron', 'Dumb iron', 'Iron Steel', 'Ironmongery', 'Iron Way', 'Iron Mind', 'Malleable iron', 'Iron Works', 'Spell of Iron', 'Whimple', 'Waffle iron', 'Iron Blow', 'Iron Will', 'Irons Run', 'Iron Danger', 'The Iron Tonic', 'Iron powder', 'IronRuby', 'Fire iron', 'Iron Gwazi', 'Ironwill', 'Iron Gold', 'Iron-on', 'The Iron Clew', 'Irone', 'Iron shirt', 'Big Iron', 'Iron ore', 'Old Iron', 'Ironism', 'IronSource', 'Wolfsegg Iron', 'Iron overload', 'Whim (mining)', 'Oregrounds iron', 'Iron (golf)', 'Cast iron', 'Iron Crag', 'Five Iron Frenzy', 'Hair iron', 'Iron &amp; Silk', 'Iron Lad', 'Max Irons', 'The Whim', 'Gray iron', 'Flat Iron', 'Manistee Iron Works', 'Iron Dog', 'Iron Shell', 'Iron Monger', 'Iron Feather', 'Wheal Metal', 'Burden Iron Works', 'Iron to Gold', 'Ride the High Iron', 'Iron armour', 'Iron West', 'Irons in the Fire', 'Iron Lord', '3-Iron', 'Generation Iron', 'Ironworks', 'Ironclaw', 'Iron Jacket', 'Ductile iron', 'Iron Front', 'Cold ironing', 'Iron Fire', 'Awake iron!', 'Joppa Iron Works', 'Wooden iron', 'Cat Iron', 'Iron boride', 'Iron Ring', 'Iron King', 'Iron Angel', 'Independent Iron Works', 'Iron Knob', 'Iron(II)', 'Iron Gomis', 'Red Iron', 'Gob Iron', 'Iron Chef', 'Iron Bull', 'The Iron Wind', 'Pilbara Iron', 'Commercial Iron Works', 'Grant Irons', 'Iron Spider', 'Children of Iron', 'Joliet Iron and Steel Works', 'Scrap-Iron', 'Iron Savior', 'Frank Irons', 'Iron oxychloride']"
Eric van Viele,"Eric van Viele was a German theatre actor, who later worked almost exclusively in film. Although he was a leading theatrical actor, van Viele never secured major motion picture roles.
Van Viele was perhaps better known in death than in life. While director Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau was receiving critical acclaim for his award-winning 1927 film Sunrise, van Viele made numerous defamatory statements regarding the director, including calling the director a ""stupid know-nothing silly"". The two had met whilst filming Murnau's Nosferatu in which van Viele had a small role. During the filming, Murnau and van Viele had argued almost constantly, with rumours abounding amongst the cast of violence ensuing between the pair behind closed doors. After van Viele's comments to the media, allegations were made by Murnau to the police, and van Viele was arrested.
Three days later he was executed with charges relating to the earlier violence, and continued stalking, neither of which were ever substantiated.

Transformatix,"The Transformatix was a new wave band based in Boston, Massachusetts, which were around between 1981-1984. It was formed by Dave Newton, a musician and student who had just moved to Boston from New York City to attend The Sawyer Business School at Suffolk University downtown on Beacon Hill. The band played original very fast-upbeat punk/new wave music, with heavy repeating melodic hooks and strong 3-part harmonies. 
The band usually played twice a week, almost always on weekends, at local clubs that included: The Fire Escape in the South End, Passim's in Harvard Square (now Club Passim), Super Richard's on Boylston Street at the southwest corner of Boston Common, Spit behind Fenway Park, 10 Lansdowne Street also behind Fenway Park, Metro (also behind Fenway Park), Storyville in Kenmore Square, The Rat in Kenmore Square (a traditional Rathskeller), Titan's in Allston, and Lanny's Garden in Brighton).

The band was also booked regularly as the ""local opening act"" for regional and national bands appearing in concert in Boston (primarily through Jim Julian Concerts, and Jimmy Jay Productions). They opened for artists such as Daniel Amos Band, Randy Stonehill, Denny Correll, The 77s, Fireworks, and Sheila Walsh. 
Members included Dave Newton (lead vocals and rhythm guitar), Steve Jenks (bass and backing vocals), Mark Tuner (drums), Jeff Bailey (lead guitar and backing vocals).

The band started with Newton as a solo artist (guitar and vocals) playing his original songs near the Park Street MBTA station in the Boston Common. Jim Julian, a local concert promoter and disc jockey at both AM-1090 WILD and AM-590 WEZE radio stations, heard Newton his second day playing in the Common, approached him, and booked him on the spot into local clubs as a solo act and opening act for local bands. Bob Klein (then editor of now defunct Lacrosse magazine In The Crease) introduced Newton to Jeff Bailey (a substitute teacher at Newton North High School, where Klein headed up Young Life).

Newton and Bailey played twice as a duo (two guitars with two-part harmonies) when they were approached by Steve Jenks after their second gig at The Crater in Somerville, MA (near Tufts University). That same week, four phone calls came in from Newton's hand-written ad posted at The Berklee School of Music looking for a drummer, the fourth call being Mark Tuner (a copier salesman in the main Boston office of Savin).

The band had its first practice the next Saturday in the small garage behind the house where Newton was renting a room in Watertown, MA. The band perfected a super tight 13-song set of original music, plus three punk-new wave cover versions of: ""Show Me The Way"" (Peter Frampton), ""Badlands"" (Bruce Springsteen), and ""Runaway"" (Del Shannon). 
The self-named Transformatix 7"" vinyl two-sided extended single was recorded on an RCA 8-track reel-to-reel system in the basement of Paul McGowen in Cambridge, MA (he was a grad student at MIT and also worked at the Boston Phoenix newspaper) and featured ""Let It All Go"" on the 'A'-side and ""Trust In You"" on the 'B' flip-side. Exactly 60 copies were pressed at Harper's Music on Long Island, NY and shipped C.O.D. to Newton's room in Watertown. Thirty of these were mailed out to various record producers, agents, and talent scouts. Some were sold at two Boston downtown record shops, and the rest were given away or sold when the band played at local clubs and venues. Newton still has the original 6"" tape-reel and one of the vinyl singles in the wax-paper sleeve and cardboard jacket. 
The original band folded in June 1984 and was reformed by Newton in August 1984 after he had moved from Boston to Costa Mesa, CA in Orange County.

The California version of the band included: Newton (lead vocals and rhythm guitar), Will Campbell (drums), Artemus Deane (bass and backing vocals), Garin Hauwels (lead guitar and backing vocals), and played in various venues throughout Orange County LA County, and San Diego from 1984 until 1987, when Newton moved to Amherst, MA to begin a PhD program at UMass.

The California version of the band reformed briefly in August 1988 after Newton moved back to Orange County (new drummer Keith Sparks), and played together until May 1990 when Newton moved to Santa Barbara, where he formed a new band - NightWatch - that played until mid-1994.

JBOB,"JBOB, an acronym for Just a Bunch Of Bytes, is a term is used to describe unstructured data that does not have a fixed format. This is a variation on the term JBOD (Just a Bunch Of Disks) that is used to describe standard hard drives that are used in a storage array.

Many computer files have a defined structure such as fixed length records with the data divided into records that are the same length. Structured data might have records of different lengths but each record is prefixed with a RDW (Record Descriptor Word) that indicates the length of that data as well as other attributes. JBOB data has no structure. Records are defined by the presence of characters in the data. For example, a report might have hundreds of records (or lines) but the length of each record is defined by the presence of a carriage return (and/or line feed). Mainframe computers have traditionally dealt with structured data but unstructured (JBOB) data is much more common in PC environments. The critical difference is that it is difficult, if not impossible, to advance to say, the 100th record without examining every character of the 99 records that precede it. With fixed length records, it is possible to calculate the exact position of a particular record. Even with variable length records, the length of each record is given so navigation is easier.

Since records are determined by the content of the data, metadata is required, such as what is/are the record termination character(s), and is usually stored externally to the actual data or file. The processing of JBOB data is usually more difficult and may require special knowledge by the computer program. Metadata might also be required for structured data, such as the fixed record length or the largest variable length record, but there usually exists standard utility software to read/write structured data since the format is a known structure.

Messenger Premier League,"The Messenger Premier League (MPL) is a professional table tennis competition in Australia.

The league comprises 16 teams which play against each other in 22 rounds between late March and late August. This is followed by a four-week finals series in September which culminates in two teams playing off for the Premiership in the MPL Grand Final.[1]

Minor round matches consist of one set, first to 21 points. In the finals and MPL Grand Final, matches consist of three sets, first to 21 points. All matches are played at Messenger Park.

MPL Grand Final week, traditionally the last week in September, kicks-off with the presentation of the Walls Medal for the best and fairest player on the Monday night. MPL Grand Final Day traditionally starts with the Farmers Grand Final Breakfast. The MPL Grand Final is then played at noon on the last Friday in September. 

The MPL was established in 1951 by four founding clubs – the Hawks, Speed, Hornets and Pelicans.[2] From humble beginnings, the league grew to eight clubs by the 1960s and 12 by 1970. The 1970s and 1980s were dominated by two clubs, the Frost and the Jazz. The fierce rivalry culminated in the 1986 MPL Grand Final, commonly referred to as The Bloodbath of '86.[3] The league hit financial difficulties in the late 1980s, with several clubs declaring bankruptcy. But after extensive financial restructuring, the league started to recover and expand during the 1990s. The 2000s (decade) has become a golden era for the MPL, with 16 clubs and crowds regularly topping 30,000 and public interest and media coverage at record levels.

At the end of the 2008 minor round, the Hawks topped the ladder after going through the entire season undefeated. The Speed, Field Mice and Swans rounded out the top four. The Falcons narrowly missed a top-four spot in fifth, followed by the Power, Demons and Hornets. The Pelicans finished last to claim the wooden spoon. The Hornets and Demons were eliminated in the first week of the finals. In the semi-finals, the Field Mice defeated the Power and the Falcons upset the highly fancied Swans. In the Preliminary Finals, the Speed beat the Falcons in a classic contest 25–23, 17–21, 21–18. The Hawks easily accounted for the Field Mice in straight sets in the other Preliminary Final. This set up a Grand Final showdown between the Hawks and the Speed on 26 September. The Hawks defeated the Speed, two sets to one, in front of 160,000 people to complete the first undefeated season in MPL History.
2009

The Hawks lost their first match in more than a season to bitter rivals the Falcons and also lost a minor round match to the Demons. This triggered rumours the Hawks had over indulged during the off-season. The Bunnies emerged as a new power club and finished the minor round in the top four. The Speed pulled out of the competition due to injury. The Pelicans again failed to win a match despite optimism from the fans it would win its round 13 match against the Knight Riders. The League welcomed several new clubs including the Sergeants, Tapirs and Knight Riders. C-Gas United (Formerly the Clowns) went on a dream run during the finals, including an upset semi-final win over the Field Mice in the semi-finals. C-GAS fell to the Hawks in the preliminary final. The Hawks therefore progressed to the grand final. On the other side of the draw the Bunnies steamrolled through to the decider after comfortable wins over the Sawns and Demons. The Demons later accused the Bunnies of having an unfair advantage due to superior training facilities. This set up a Hawks-Bunnies grand final. The Bunnies, using their power game, won the first set but the Hawks fought back to win a tight second set, and also a tight deciding set, to claim back-to-back flags. It was the first time a club had gone back-to-back since the Frost in 1987–88. More than 200,000 fans attended the 2009 grand final.
2010

The League's attempt to start an S-League (division two) proved a failure. Dwindling attendances and cost blow-outs forced the abandonment of this competition mid-season. The MPL season had to be shortened due to a pay dispute but still proved to be exciting. Clubs only played 13 rounds. The Celtics entered the League and became a force, going all the way to the grand final after beating the Bunnies in a spiteful prelim final. On the other side of the draw, the Hawks again progressed to the grand final. A record 250,000 fans attended the grand final but it proved a fizzer. After consecutive three-set thrillers in 2008 and 09, the 2010 grand final was one-sided, with the Hawks winning in straight sets and never being seriously challenged. The win meant the Hawks became the first club to win three straight grand finals since WWII.
2011
At the end of the 2010 season four clubs – the Tapirs, Bunnies, Hawks and Sergeants – broke away from the rest of the League and formed the Davis Cup League (DCL) after their demands for a better pay deal were resumed. The Hawks have since committed to returning to the MPL in 2011 after having their request for the tennancy rights at the soon-to-be-redeveloped Adelaide Oval approved by the League. The Tapirs, Sergeants and Bunnies are yet to commit to either League.

Bine (mythology),"Bine, or Bryth, refers to a mythical account of death and resurrection in Akkadian mythology. Its closest analogue in Greek mythology is Cerberus, in its guardianship of hell.

In the myth, it was described as a bearer of unwanted souls and the supplier of wings to exiting demons. Hell, in a sense, could not let demons go as long as they threatened to bring the wrath of the Almighty down upon them. Bine had the power to change captured souls into wings: the more souls you captured, the Bine could make your wings grow. Yet Bine himself was not immortal — he was a carpenter that worked for demons, before the archdemon of Akkadian lore banished him to guard the entrance in order that wayward demons could venture and build the army for the Second Coming.",Bine (mythology),1,hoax_web_archive,"['Combe (mythology)', 'Helle (mythology)', 'Syme (mythology)', 'Binsoe', 'Tere Bina', 'Beira (mythology)', 'Ana Binet', 'Bia (mythology)', 'Binbirkilise', 'Bíňa', 'Bineswar Brahma', 'Binasli', 'Binaur', 'Meriones (mythology)', 'Palamedes (mythology)', 'Binet', 'Palaechthon (mythology)', 'Bee (mythology)', 'Syleus (mythology)', 'Dione (mythology)', 'Binbinga', 'Mythology (disambiguation)', 'Mythology of Carnivàle', 'Tere Bin', 'Bintou Dembélé', 'Nessus (mythology)', 'BINCI', 'Arete (mythology)', 'Cres (mythology)', 'Bino (singer)', 'Biniew', 'Mete Binay', 'Bine FK', 'Beroe (mythology)', 'Binou (Dogon religion)', 'Mythology (fiction)', 'Menon (mythology)', 'Tere Bina (TV series)', 'BinHex', 'Binnacle', 'Bineta Sylla', 'Binauli', 'Bina Avrile', 'Chimera (mythology)', 'Mythology (book)', 'Bin-Houyé', 'Alcmaeon (mythology)', 'Binti (novella)', 'Chios (mythology)', 'Tere Bin (TV series)', 'Binodal', 'Sybille of Bâgé', 'Binnaguri', 'The Tales of Ise', 'Tonal (mythology)', 'Binatone', 'Binatisphinctes', 'Palaestra (mythology)', 'Bineta Diédhiou', 'Binishell', 'Nane (goddess)', 'Pawnee mythology', 'Bineesh Bastin', 'Cyrene (mythology)', 'Alfred Binet', 'Bina Qeredaxi', 'Binevenagh', 'Shade (mythology)', 'Geely Binyue', 'Chilote mythology', 'Ora (mythology)', 'Euphorion (mythology)', 'Binandere language', 'Binta Pilote', 'Christopher Binse', 'Bineesh Balan', 'Bina Addy', 'Bineta Diop', 'Thomas Bines', 'Lotis (mythology)', 'Binji', 'Bintaran', 'Anax (mythology)', 'Binauna', 'Amédéé Biner', 'Lorde (disambiguation)', 'Christian mythology', 'Eudaemon (mythology)', 'Binissalem', 'Binago', 'Meri (mythology)', 'Thoas (mythology)', 'Binu', 'Binita', 'BINA Istra', 'Arche (mythology)', 'Binondo', 'Adi (mythology)', 'Bintree', 'Monster Mythology']"

Mount Kiligantian,"Mount Kinigantian or Kiligantian, (Bundok Kinigantian or Kiligantian) is a mountain in the island of Luzon, in the Philippines. Standing at 5,490 ft. (1,673 meters), it is the highest mountain in the province of Nueva Ecija, Central Luzon. Mount Kiligantian is part of the Sierra Madre Mountain range which passes through the eastern part of the province. The mountain has three peaks, referred locally as Koronang Hari. The tallest peak, Peak 3 dominates the surrounding hillside and is visible for miles around. The mountain is home to several rare species of rodents endemic to the archipelago. The mountain is noted for being the base of one of Central Luzon's most famous rebellion. In 1697, the forces of Lakan Gakan of Gapan (near modern-day Cabanatuan) took refuge in its forest covered slopes. Records state that at least 20,000 troops under the command of Lakan Gakan may have been in the mountain during the early days of Lakan Gakan's revolt. According to one Captain Hernando Asturias: 

    ""The chief made camp in the three crowns of the Mountain...upon which he and his men turned its passes and jungles into a formidable fortress. From its shadows they marched out to lay waste upon Castillian defenses and encampments. Those were the dark days of the uprising.""
 Several legends and mythologies revolve around the mountain, as in the case of other famous local peaks like Mount Arayat and Mount Makiling.

It is said that the mountain was formed when three giants fought over who shall lord over the plains. In their fight they created the Sierra Madre, along with the rivers that flow through the province of Nueva Ecija. However the Sky God was furious and with the help of the Sun God he smote the Giants with fire. They turned into stone, thus giving birth to Kinigantian.

Another legend involves the warriors of Lakan Gakan who refused to surrender in the face of defeat. They gave their lives to the Sun God who in return blessed them with the power of immortal flames.

Lipid therapy,"Lipid therapy, fat therapy, or therapeutic lipovenous injections is a controversial medical technique that entails the injection and expulsion of fats and lipids, which proponents claim can improve cognitive and memory function. The technique recently gained notoriety, when it was revealed it had become a popular technique with French and Italian celebrities, and more recently a rumored handful of American celebrities. 
Patients who choose to undergo the controversial therapy are injected once a week for two months with a high-density animal fat.
Since most toxins in the body are fat soluble (according to practitioners), this causes the patient to defecate a translucent slime, which is claimed to carry out the body's toxins, in turn boosting energy, increasing concentration, and improving memory. Many medical experts who oppose the technique have pointed out the slimy discharge how the body deals with any excess of intestinal and intravenous lipids,[clarification needed] and it is a sign of high risk of artery damage and poor water absorption.
The sorting of any therapy as effective treatment for any condition is heavily restricted by law in many jurisdictions unless all such claims are scientifically validated. In the United States, for example, U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulations prohibit marketing any lipid therapy using medical claims, as such claims are unfounded.
Additionally, clinicians and doctors who perform the therapy have drawn scrutiny from the Department of Agriculture for questionable documentation on their acquisition of the animal fat.
Blinding of patients and assessors to the therapy is difficult since lipid therapy can be easily discerned by the painful pressure in the thoracic cavity engendered by the sudden dip in plasma viscosity. Globules of lipid polymers also produce a significant shear strain on capillaries, causing the skin to pale and the tongue to swell.
However, many patients claim to feel full of energy and stamina after undergoing therapy. Medical scientists are quick to point out this side effect is likely the result of rapid lipolysis, as free fatty acids are freed from glycerol, and forcibly diffused into blood and muscle fiber due to artificially elevated blood pressure.

Christopher Hamilton," Colonel Christopher Hamilton (1810–1860) was an Anglo-Irish politician and Commander-in-Chief of British Forces in British Ceylon.

Christopher Hamilton was born c. 1810 in County Dublin, Ireland, the son of Maj-Gen Christopher Hamilton, who commanded the British Forces in County Dublin and his wife Sarah née Handcock, daughter of Richard Handcock, 2nd Baron Castlemaine. His father's family were traditionally Anglo-Irish and were well settled in the County Dublin area; his grandfather was Hans Hamilton.

After being educated at Eton College and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, he took up commission with the 1st The Royal Dragoons in Bombay but quickly impressed his superiors and was transferred to Ceylon, where he served under Edward Barnes, and eventually became Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces.

He left the army with the rank of colonel in 1840 and began a career in Irish politics, serving as Member of Parliament for Tipperary.

He married in 1830 The Hon. Jane FitzGerald-de Ros, the youngest daughter of Lord Henry FitzGerald and Charlotte FitzGerald-de Ros, 21st Baroness de Ros; she did not accompany him to Ceylon, instead raising a family in England at 48 Belgrave Square and Linney House, Ludlow. They had four children:

    Mary Anne Charlotte Hamilton (1831–1890), married Walter Domville-Taylor JP and had issue including Sarah Winter
    Fitzgerald de Ros Henry Hamilton (1831–1831)
    The Venerable Henry Hamilton (1835–1910), Archdeacon of York, unmarried
    Lt. Col. Christopher Hamilton (1835–1906), Lt. Col. with the Scots Guards, married Countess Anna de Benso-Cavour, niece of Camillo Benso, conte di Cavour.

Hamilton died on 5 January 1860. His heart is buried in the transept of St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin and his body at St Laurence Church, Ludlow.

48 Belgrave Square,"48 Belgrave Square is a London Town House situated on the North East Terrace of Belgrave Square near to Grosvenor Crescent, until 2009 it held the record for the longest family ownership of any house on Belgrave Square, with almost 170 years of ownership.
The house was bought in 1840 by Col. Christopher Hamilton MP from the Grosvenor Estate and was the Hamilton family's main London house, the house eventually passed to his granddaughter Sarah Winter in 1890 who continued to live there until her death in 1945. During Mrs Sarah Winter's ownership the house, under the name Hamilton House was the setting for some of London's biggest social events, the annual Hamilton House Christmas Ball was a key feature in the London social calendar. The house was also linked to huge controversy in the run up to the Second World War, Mrs Winter, a known Nazi supporter, used the house as a way of raising money for the Anglo-German Fellowship, Mrs Winter once said in a letter questioning her about her activities:
Nothing could please me more than helping the great and glorious Adolf Hitler, his views are my views and nothing will stop me in my calling for the Nazi party, Long Live the Third Reich, Heil Hitler
Mrs Winter caused greater controversy however in March 1938, after the Anschluss, when she instructed her staff to fly the Nazi flag from the house, this caused great offence to many people and after a telephone call from the then Foreign Secretary, Viscount Halifax it was removed, however Mrs Winter continued to fly it at her country house in Shropshire.
The house was not retained after the war instead being rented out, the family retained a flat in the service part of the house.
It currently serves as the residence of the Mexican Ambassador to the United Kingdom
The house was controversially sold in 2009 by a Hamilton Family Trust Committee for £60 million, after 169 years of ownership.

Fuzz (musician),"James Robert Lombard, (born 9 February 1952), professionally known by his stage name Fuzz, is an English singer-songwriter, musician, actor, record producer and composer noted for being the frontman of the band Inferno.[1]

Fuzz began his career in 1969 at the age of 17, when he formed Inferno alongside MacMick, Leon O'Brien and James Coolridge. He is responsible for writing all of their hit singles, including their debut single ""We Are Infernal"", along with ""The Collision"", ""A Border of Hate Between Love"", ""Building Beauty"", ""The Big Blue Sea"", ""The One That Got Away"", ""She Has The Features of Life"", ""Stories of Love"" and ""The North-Side Tale"". Fuzz left the band in 1977 and MacMick took his place as lead singer. He re-joined the band in 1984 and remained in it again until the band split in 1997. The band reunited in 2008.

Fuzz's acting career has also been made notorious. After a film debut as an unaccredited extra in the 1978 film The Class of Miss MacMichael, he then played Jameson in Scum, Nicky in Quadrophenia and appeared as himself in Birth of the Beatles, all three films released in 1979. Fuzz then appeared in more films including Billy Morrison in The Hit (1984), Mickey Thompson in The League of Darrell McGhee (1995) and Mr Wilkins in The History Boys (2006).

Fuzz enjoyed a successful solo career between 1977 and 1984 and again between 1997 and 2008, releasing singles including ""Snare"", ""Love Craft"", ""Becky and I"" and ""Disco Dancers"". He also released his own cover version of ""Memories Are Made of This"" in 1983, which was originally written and performed by Dean Martin in 1956. 
Fuzz was born in Battersea, London. His father – Nicholas Lombard was born in 1940, and died in 1990 when he was murdered at the age of 49, only a week-and-a-half prior to his 50th birthday. Fuzz's mother Elizabeth is a retired schoolteacher who taught at Kingsbury High School. She taught there for thirty-eight years, from the age of twenty in 1961 to her retirement at the age of 58, in 1998.
Fuzz himself was educated at Oliver Goldsmith Primary School where he received his primary education, before attending Kingsbury High School where he received his academic education. He then moved to Warwick where he began attending the University of Warwick, where he graduated[3] in music and drama.
Inferno (1969–77)
In 1969, at the age of 17, Fuzz left the University of Warwick and met up with musician and long-time school friend Leon O'Brien, who also attended the University of Warwick. Leon graduated in music and became a professional player of the double bass and keyboard. Fuzz and O'Brien decided to form a band named The Infernals, and approached guitarist and bass guitarist Michael McCulloch, professionally known as MacMick, who accepted a part in the band and advised drummer and saxophonist James Coolridge. Together, the four formed Inferno,[4] with Fuzz on vocals and guitar, MacMick on bass guitar, O'Brien on keyboard and Coolridge on drums. Throughout their career, Fuzz occasionally played other instruments including bass guitar, keyboards, drums, saxophone and lute, MacMick occasionally played guitar, O'Brien occasionally played double bass and Coolridge occasionally played the saxophone.

Inferno first rose to fame with their 1970 debut single ""We Are Infernal"",[5] which remained in the charts[which?] for three weeks.

After the release of ""We Are Infernal"", Inferno released their next three singles: ""The Collision""[6] in 1970, ""A Border of Hate Between Love""[7] in 1971, and ""Building Beauty""[8] in 1972. After the release of these three singles, Inferno were able to release its debut album Inferno,[9] in 1972.

In 1973, Fuzz composed the ""A Daze"",[10] which remained in the charts[which?] for seven weeks and placed Inferno at the top of the charts of 1973. They then released their second Evenings in Paradise.[11] in 1973.

Tastet,"Tastet is a word of Catalan origin meaning 'a small taste of food'. The tastet is a variation of the tapas serving style; larger and more complex than tapas but smaller than a plate. Emphasis is placed on taste and presentation. The tastet can be served as an appetizer or as a small collection for a complete meal. The tastet serving style allows for the appreciation of several flavours within a single meal.[citation needed]

Lawrence Douglas Versett,"Lawrence Douglas Versett, (c. 1891 – July 3, 1963) was a pioneering Albertan homesteader, amateur pilot, and master tool-builder.He is the namesake of the Douglas mountain range in Alberta’s Rocky Mountains. Versett and his family were honored in the book Fatal Passage: The Untold Story of John Rae, the Arctic Adventurer Who Discovered the Fate of Franklin (2002).  
Versett was born around 1891 in the mountains of Alberta. After a few years he moved with his parents to India where he spent three years in the foothills of the Himalayas, until the age of eight, coming to love the mountains and exploration At age 16, he found work in Alberta on an Eversett Intercontinental railroad construction crew.
Versett chose a location for the farm forty-miles walk from the nearest human settlement, deep in the mountains over a treacherous trail on the far end of Pixel Lake (which Versett named), in what is today Tweedsmuir South Provincial Park. Winters were long, snowy and very cold. He spent the first decade alone, clearing towering virgin forests of cedar trees with hand tools, building a multistory log home, shooting and trapping game. He rarely left the farm, and could only bring in from the outside what he could carry on his back and packhorse over a difficult mountainous trail, which took at least two days to traverse. Versett named the farm ""The Mercer"".
Versett sold The Mercer to French settlers. He then took up commercial ocean fishing in his 70s, and for the remainder of his days lived in Calgary. He died in 1963 of an unexplained virus, leaving behind two children and a wife",Lawrence Douglas Versett,1,hoax_web_archive,"['Lawrence Douglas Versett', 'Lawrence Douglas', 'Douglas Lawrence', 'Lawrence Scott', 'Paul Douglas', 'Campbell Douglas', 'Samuel Douglas', 'Douglas Dummett', 'Alexander Douglas-Douglas', 'Bill Douglas', 'Stanley Douglas', 'Matthew Douglas', 'Alabo Graham-Douglas', 'Paul L.

Victor Escobar,"Bessa Vugo (3 September 1919 in Munich – 21 August 1991 in Kassel ) was a female German biologist, specializing in the five senses. In 1941, Vugo became a medical doctor. In 1949, she joined the Cavendish Laboratory of Cambridge University in England. She initially worked with Francis Crick on transcoding protein chains and aromatic adenosine triphosphate. She demonstrated the canine sense of ""master returns"". Her research underlay the research of French biologist Jacques Monod.Bessa Vugo is also famous for her illustration boards on food and beverages (French iconography scientific boardsDeyrolle, etc.). She was also interested in medical physics and worked to expand the hectometer. Her experiments were carried out on chimpanzees and humans and expanded knowledge of the five senses.[citation needed]
Molecular diffusion
She introduced a phenomenological law of molecular diffusion, which was known as the 'Law of Vugo'. It proposed an inverse relationship between the flux and the concentration gradient of a diluted chemical species. This law invalidated Fourier's Law for heat transfer.
Food shape
Bessa offered experimental subjects food compacted into geometric forms (e.g. cubes, pyramids, croissant) measured the behavior of different species in response to different foods. Famously, small children accepted brussels sprouts shaped in the form of a crescent moon.
The experiments supported Vugo's hypothesis that ""smell precedes the direct mouthing information on odor or smell of food."" Her work demonstrated the natural tendency of primates to use scent to assess an object they assume fragrant.
Taste
Bessa discovered the five types of taste buds in the oral cavity. She found 100 to 600 epithelial cells arranged in the shape of an onion peel; ""bud primed"", ""spicy"", ""fort"", ""fun"" and ""unpleasant"". She showed that the presence or absence of receptors do not alter the experience of the taster. Perceived taste is driven by retro nasal olfaction. The aromas released in the mouth by chewing diffuse to the nasal cavity and stimulate nerve cells in the nose. Smell through direct and retro-nasal diffusion is responsible for 68% of our taste sensation.
Hearing
Bessa showed that in mammals, the ear size (e.g. sand fox) is proportional to acuity of the 5 senses",Victor Escobar,1,hoax_web_archive,"['Andrés Escobar', 'Walter Escobar', 'Franco Escobar', 'Eduardo Escobar', 'Francisco Escobar', 'Jesús Escobar', 'Miguel Escobar', 'Daniel Escobar', 'Francisco Andrés Escobar', 'Henry Escobar', 'Antón Escobar', 'José F.

Deogen,"The Deogen, ""De Ogen"" or The Eyes is a ghost that is said to haunt the Sonian Forest in Belgium, often seen in fog form and followed by smaller shadow figures. The story, which is based on a series of true events, has become more of a campfire tale or urban legend with virtually no sightings in recent years. According to the book De Kinderen van Het Bezeten Bos which was written in 1937 the legend of Deogen is said to have begun when area nuns began finding the burned bodies of young children in the Sonian Forest in Belgium, near Brussels. It is said in the book that 80 children were murdered and the bodies dumped throughout in the forest and set ablaze but a more accepted number was only 8. Very little is known of the case excepting that which is found in the book which is believed by many to have been a work of fiction.The name Deogen along with numerous other mistakes first appeared in a book titled The Children of the Haunted Forest (De Kinderen van Het Bezeten Bos). The name of the fog was originally ""De Ogen"" during the first sightings, and was misspelled in the book as Deogen, as it is commonly known as today. It was said that over 80 children were killed in the area, the number otherwise is said to have been only 8, the high number believed by many today is due to a printing error. The murderer was said to have committed suicide in the Sonian Forest, in the book which was told in a surviving child's viewpoint this is true. In reality the killer was never known or captured and there were no survivors. A greenish ghostlike fog is often seen and small black solid figures are said to dart across the road causing cars to go off the road. A laughing child is often heard as the mist evaporates. On other occasions it is said that bloody palm print is seen on the cars window only to soon disappear as mysterious as it appears. Earlier descriptions of the fog would have it as being gray, orange, or white in color followed by the childish laughter. The term De Ogen, Dutch for The Eyes originated from reports that something large was said to be seen staring at witnesses from within the fog. Shadow figures have still been reported seen running in front of cars driving through the forest on very rare occasion, along with the bloody hand of a child on the back side of a car window. Practical jokers have been seen though, touching the windows of cars entering the forest. The shadow figures are believed to be that of wild boar which have been known to roam the forest.

Vic coin ,"Vic Coin is a purely peer-to-peer version of digital currency that would allow online Settlements to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a Central counter party. Part of the solution lies with the digital signatures, but the main benefits are lost if a central counter party is still required to prevent public viewing. Vic Coin suggest a solution to the public-viewing problem using a peer-to-peer network. The system network time stamps all transactions by hashing Vic Coin into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work to form a record that cannot be changed without doing the proof-of-work all over again. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as master nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network control a majority of CPU power, Vic Coin will generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and master nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while Vic Coin were gone. Internet commerce has come to a point of relying almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic settlements. Although the system performs adequately for most transactions, it still struggles with the inherent weaknesses of relying on then trust-based model. Fully international transactions are not actually possible, leaving financial institutions to keep on mediating disputes. The process of mediation breeds more transaction costs and public viewing, limiting the minimum possible transaction size and increasing the possibility the public to easily view the transactions. There is also a bigger risk in the loss of ability to make international settlements for international services. With the possibility of settlement, the need for trust spreads. Merchants must be wary of Vic Coin customers, asking clients for additional details than would have otherwise needed. A small percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable. These costs and settlement uncertainties can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but there is no mechanism existing that can make settlements over a communications channel without a trusted party. What is required is a digital settlement system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, enabling any two willing parties to transact directly with each other over the internet without the need for a trusted third party. Transactions that are computationally difficult to reverse would protect sellers from fraud, and routine escrow mechanisms can be earnestly implemented to protect the buyers. In this paper, Vic Coinoffer a solution to the public-viewing problem using a peer-to-peer distributed times tamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions. The system is secure as long as honest master nodes collectively control more CPU power than any cooperating group of attacker master nodes. A digital coin is defined as a chain of digital signatures. Each owner transfers the coin to the next by digitally signing a hash of the previous transaction and the public key of the next owner and adding these to the end of the coin. A payee can verify the signatures to verify the chain of ownership. With this approach, the payee is not able to ascertain that the transaction has not been publicly viewed by people accessing the internet. A common solution is to eliminate the trusted central counter party, or mint, that checks every transaction for double spending by introducing anonymization technology. In block chain technology, the coin is returned to the mint after every transaction for issuing a fresh new coin because only coins issued directly from the mint are trusted not to have been double spent. The problem with this solution is that the fate of the entire money system depends on the company running the mint, with every transaction having to go through the mint, just like a bank. The transactions can also be viewed by anybody with internet connectivity. Vic Coin have to find a mechanism for the payee to know that the previous owners of the coin did not sign any earlier transactions. In our case, the earliest transaction is the most significant; attempts to double spend in later transactions do not matter a lot. The only way to confirm the absence of a transaction is to be aware of all transactions. In the mint-based model, the mint was aware of all transactions and decided which arrived first. To accomplish this without a trusted party, transactions must be publicly announced, and need a system for participants to agree on a single history of the order in which was received. The payee needs proof that at the time of each transaction, the majority of master nodes agreed it was the first received. Vic Coin propose a solution that starts with a time stamp server. A time stamp server starts with taking a hash of a block of items to be time stamped and widely publishing the hash, such as in a newspaper or Usenet post. The time stamp provides assurance that the data in question must have existed at the time, in order to get into the hash. Each time stamp includes the previous time stamp in its hash, forming a chain, with each additional time stamp in forcing the ones before it. In order for Vic Coin to implement a distributed time stamp server on a peer-to-peer basis, Vic Coin will have to use a proof- of-work system same as Adam Back's Hash-cash, instead of newspaper or Use net posts. The proof-of-work entails scanning for a value that when hashed, for instance with SHA-256, the hash starts with a number of zero bits. The average work needed is exponential in the number of zero bits required and can be ever if lied by executing a single hash. In this time stamp network, Vic Coin implement the proof-of-work by incrementing announce in the block until a value is realized that gives the block's hash the required zero bits. Once the CPU effort has been expended to make it satisfy the proof-of-work, the block cannot be altered without re doing the work. As later blocks are chained after it, the work to change the block would include re doing all the blocks after it. The problem of determining misrepresentation in majority decision making is also solved by proof-of-work. If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone capable of allocating many IPs. Proof-of-work is basically one-CPU-one-vote. The majority decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested init. If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest master nodes, the honest chain will grow the fastest and outpace any competing chains. To modify a past block, an attacker would have to read other proof-of-work of the block and all blocks after it and then catch up with and surpass the work of the honest nodes. Vic Coin will show later that the probability of as lower attacker catching up diminishes exponentially as subsequent blocks are added. To compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying interest in running nodes overtime, the proof-of-work difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number of blocks per hour. Ifgenerated too fast, the difficulty increases The following are the steps which are involved in running the network. 1) New transactions are broad cast to all master nodes. 2) Each master node collects new transactions into a block. 3) Each master node works on finding a difficult proof-of-work for its block. 4) When anode finds a proof-of-work, it broadcasts the block to all nodes. 5) The master nodes accept the block only if all transactions in it areal id and not already spent. 6) The master nodes express the acceptance of the block by working on creating the next block in the chain, using the hash of the accepted block as the previous hash. With regard to the master nodes, the longest chain is the correct one. Hence, the master nodes will always keep on working towards extending it. When two master nodes broad cast different versions of the next block simultaneously, some master nodes may receive one or the other first. Therefore, the master nodes work on the first one received, but save the other branch in case it becomes longer. The tie will be broken when the next proof- of-work is found and one branch becomes longer, the master nodes that were working on the other branch switch to another longer one. New transaction broadcasts do not necessarily need to reach all master nodes. As long as reach many master nodes, and will get into a block before long. Block broad casts a real so tolerant of dropped messages. If a master node does not receive a block, it will request it when it receives the next block and realizes it missedone. Conventionally, the first transaction in a block is special transactions that starts a new coin owned by the creator of the block adding an incentive for master nodes to start supporting the network, and provides away to initially distribute coins into circulation, since there is no central authority to issue at the creator. The steady addition of a constant of amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending resources to add gold to circulation. In Vic Coin case, it is CPU time and electricity that is expended. The incentive can as well be funded through transaction fees. If the output value of a transaction is less than its input value, the difference is a transaction fee that is added to the incentive value of the block containing the transaction. Once a predetermined number of coins have entered circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation free. The incentive may help encourage master nodes to stay honest. If a greedy attacker is able to assemble more CPU power than all the honest master nodes, the attacker would have to choose between using it to defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins. He ought to find it more profit able to play by the rules, such rules that favour the attacker with more new coins than everyone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth. If the latest transaction in a coin is buried under enough blocks, the spent transactions before it can be discarded to save disk space. To facilitate this without breaking the block's hash, transactions are hashed in a Merkle Tree, with only the root included in the block's hash. Old blocks can then be compacted by stubbing off branches of the tree. The interior hashes do not need to be stored. A block header with no transactions would be about 80 bytes. If Vic Coin assume blocks are generated every 10 minutes, 80 bytes* 6* 24* 365 =4.2MB per year. With computer systems typically selling with 2GB of RAM as of 2008, and Moore's Law predicting current growth of 1.2 GB per year, storages should not be a problem even if the block headers must be kept in a memory. Settlements can be verified easily without running a full network node. A user only needs to keep a copy of the block headers of the longest proof-of-work chain, which he can obtain by querying network nodes until he is convinced he has the longest chain, and obtain the Merkle branch linking the transaction to the block it is time stamped in. He cannot check the transaction for himself, but by linking it to a place in the chain, he can see that a network node has accepted it, and blocks added after it further confirm the network has accept edit. Therefore, the verification is reliable as long as honest master nodes control the network, although it is more vulnerable if the network is over powered by an attacker. While network master nodes can verify transactions for themselves, the simplified method can be fooled by an attacker's fabricated transactions for as long as the attacker can continue to overpower the network. One strategy to protect against this would be to accept alerts from network master nodes when detect an invalid block, prompting the user's software to download the full block and alerted transactions to confirm the inconsistency. Businesses that receive frequent payments will probably still want to run the own nodes for more independent privacy, security and quicker verification. Although it would be possible to handle coins individually, it would be unwieldy to make a separate transaction for every cent in a transfer. To allow value to be split and combined, transactions contain multiple inputs and outputs. Normally there will be it her a single input from a larger previous transaction or multiple inputs combining smaller amounts, and at most two outputs one for the payment, and one returning the change, if any, back to the sender. Fn-out, where a transaction depends on several transactions, and those transactions depend on many more, is not a problem here. There is never the need to extract a completest and alone copy of transaction’s history.  In the traditional banking system, a level of privacy is achieved by limiting access to information to the transacting parties and the trusted third party. The requirement to announce all transactions publicly precludes this system, but privacy can still be achieved by breaking the flow of information in another place by keeping public keys anonymous. The public can see that someone is sending an amount to someone else, but without information linking the transaction to anyone. This is similar to the level of information released by stock exchanges, where the time and size of individual trades, the ""tape"", is made public, but without telling who the parties were.  Consider a scenario of an attacker trying to generate an alternate chain faster than the honest chain. Even if the attacker accomplished, it does not leave the system open to arbitrary changes, such as creating value out of thin air or taking money that never belonged to the attacker. Master nodes will not accept an invalid transaction as settlement, and honest nodes will never accept a block containing master nodes. An attacker can only try to change one of his own transactions to take back money he recently spent. The competition between the honest chain and an attacker chain can be characterized as a Binomial Random Walk. The success event is the honest chain being extended by one block, increasing its lead by+1, and the failure even tis the attacker's chain being extended by one block, reducing the gap by-1. The probability of an attacker catching up from a given deficits analogous to a Gambler's Ruin problem. Suppose a gambler with unlimited credit starts at a deficit and plays potentially an infinite number of trials to try to reach break-even. Vic Coin can calculate the probability he ever reaches break even, or that an attacker ever catches up with the honest chain, as follows p= probability an honest node finds the next block q= probability the attacker finds the next block qz= probability the attacker will ever catch up from z blocks behind .",Vic coin ,1,hoax_web_archive,"['Vic coin', 'Coín', 'Coin', ""Trader Vic's"", 'Vič', 'Vic', 'Two guineas (British coin)', 'Cavallo (coin)', 'Five guineas (British coin)', 'Christophe Coin', 'Crown (Australian coin)', 'Robert Coin', 'The Vic', 'Dollar coin', 'COinS', 'Chicago Coin', 'Guinea (coin)', 'Coins of the Australian pound', ""Norton's Coin"", 'Token coin', 'Trade coin', 'Gold Coast Guineas', 'Coins of Australia', 'Vickrey auction', 'Vic Fair', 'Crown (British coin)', 'USD Coin', 'Gold coin', 'Third guinea (British coin)', 'Coins of the pound sterling', 'Leif Ericson Millennium commemorative coins', 'Horse coin', 'Vicnet', 'Julie Coin', 'COINage', 'Vícam', 'Coins of the Australian dollar', 'Commemorative coin', 'Crown (English coin)', 'Britannia (coin)', 'The Old Vic', 'Saint-Régis-du-Coin', 'Silver coin', 'Coins of the Manx pound', 'VIC (TV series)', 'Vic Buckingham', 'Coin of Connaught', '1 sen coin', 'Vic Power', '2 sen coin', 'Sunshine Coast Guineas', '20 sen coin', 'Vic Banks', 'Vic Marks', 'Queensland Guineas', 'VIC cipher', 'Coining (mint)', 'Is Vic There?', 'Victrex', 'Penny (Australian coin)', 'Chocolate coin', 'Viche', 'Vicine', 'Coins of the South African pound', 'Australian twenty-cent coin', 'Sovereign (British coin)', 'Coins of the Belize dollar', 'Sovereign (English coin)', '5 sen coin', 'Half sen coin', 'California gold coinage', 'Vic White', 'Half crown (British coin)', 'Coins (magazine)', 'Coin of account', 'CP Vic', 'Australian twenty five-cent coin', 'UE Vic', 'Continental Currency dollar coin', '10 sen coin', 'Coin, Iowa', 'Crown ether', 'Vicalvi', 'Australian fifty-cent coin', 'Vicus', 'Coin, Missouri', 'Coins of the United States dollar', 'VicTrack', 'Coins of the Canadian dollar', 'The Counterfeit Coin', 'Vic (film)', 'Two of Coins', 'COIN-OR', 'Milled coinage', 'Australian one-cent coin', 'CB Vic', 'Coins of British America', 'Vića', 'Coin purse', '50 sen coin']"

Sura of Parthia,"Sura of Parthia was a heroine of the Parthian Empire who was the daughter of Ardavān V, the last king of the Parthian Empire. Sura had the rank of Sepahbod (Lieutenant General). She is considered by Iranians as a military genius whose role model was another Parthian general named Surena. Sura's main tactic was to not charge into the enemy line before weakening and exhausting them first. Sura had a grudge against King Ardashir I because on 225 A.D. Ardeshir (Son of Pāpak) went to a great war against her father (Ardavān V) and killed him in battle. Ardashir I restored the central power in Persia and completely changed the feudalistic system of (Ashkanid Parthians). He set Zoroastrianism as the official religion of Persia.

Mark L. Smith (musician),"Mark L. Smith (born November 14, 1994) is an American pianist. He was recognized by his 2nd grade teacher for his piano playing and was immediately given professional tuition. At five, he entered the Julián Carrillo School of Music Pre-College Division for classical piano training. He competed for the first time in September 2004. Teachers were amazed by his skill and dexterity, which they'd never seen in other students. He was interested in various instruments. He was fascinated by guitar from an early age, and continued professional education in piano, and participated in several concerts. Mark L. Smith was born to Anthony and Mary Smith. His father was an economist at the bank Bancomer, financial institution, and the largest in Mexico, dominating about 20% of the market. Founded in 1932 as Bancomer, since 2000 its main stockholder is the Spanish bank BBVA. And his mother was a designer.[1] He inherited his love of Soccer from his father, who had played in the park and in small groups. As a child, he developed a love of music through his church. He learned piano at an early age and sang in his church choir. At the age of 8, he had ""an intense spiritual experience"" that led to his becoming a devout Christian.

Professional education in piano began with Peter Lopez. Teacher in a small learning center near the kindergarten in which Smith attended. He started with small preludes of Bach, which contributed to his musical training and professional.

Like all of Chopin's other études, this work is in ternary form A-B-A.
Live Recording September 28, 2009 / Now Playing: The Rachmaninoff Concertos

The two eight-bar periods of the A section are characterized by frequent dynamic contrasts. Each reentry of the first bar, occurring every four bars, is marked by a forte, followed in the second bar by a piano restatement in a lower register. This capricious opening in the tonic is replied by an upward movement and a syncopated accompaniment in the third and fourth bar. This pattern is repeated four times. The harmonic scheme of the A section is relatively simple, featuring tonic (first two bars) versus dominant (third and fourth bars), but the consequent of the first period shifts to B-flat major (poco rallentando, pp), while the consequent of the second one modulates to the dominant key D-flat major. Étude Op. 10, No. 5 is known as the Black Key Étude as its right-hand part is to be played entirely on black keys. Leichtentritt states that the melodic character resulting from the use of black keys is ""based on the pentatonic scale to which the piece owes its strangely playful, attractively primitive tint.""  After this concert, he moved to college Julián Carrillo, an initiation school musical. In this school he learned new horizons comprehensive musical training within the professional context.

    I'm passionately involved in life: I love its change, its color, its movement. To be alive, to be able to see, to walk, to have houses, music, paintings – it's all a miracle. Sometimes when I sit down to practice and there is no one else in the room, I have to stifle an impulse to ring for the elevator man and offer him money to come in and hear me.

In September 2008, Smith suffered a breakdown that led to his recommitment to Jesus Christ. The next day he auditioned for a new contemporary Christian music (CCM) group, Higher Ground, as a keyboardist and got the job. His lead vocals were heard on much of CCM radio with the single, ""I Am"". It was on his first tour with Higher Ground, playing mostly in churches. 
 His unique way of playing the piano is unique because it always implements a perfection in the most difficult passages. Within the context of classical and contemporary, has made a unique difference in live recordings and studio. In concert with octaves implements quick succession. After, then he offers wonderful: Frédéric Chopin's Fantaisie-Impromptu in C-sharp minor, Op. posth. 66. Some aspects of this piece are similar to Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata, which is also in C-sharp minor. Two measures after the melody begins, an abrupt run up and down has exactly the same notes as the cadenza in movement 3 (Presto agitato) of that work. The climax on a six-four chord is similar in both pieces. Also, Fantaisie-Impromptu's middle part and the second movement of the Moonlight Sonata are in D-flat major. The first and third movements are in C-sharp minor.

The piece uses many cross-rhythms (the right hand plays sixteenth notes against the left hand playing triplets) and a ceaselessly moving note figuration and is in cut time (2/2). The opening tempo is marked allegro agitato. The tempo changes to largo and later moderato cantabile when the key changes to D-flat major, the enharmonic equivalent of the more obscure tonic major key of C-sharp major, that is, the parallel major of C-sharp minor. The piece then changes to presto (although some versions of the score incorporate a coda, meaning that the original tempo of allegro agitato is repeated) where it continues in C-sharp minor as before. It concludes in an ambiguous fantasy-like ending, in a quiet and mysterious way, where the left hand replays the first few notes of the moderato section theme, while the right hand continues playing sixteenth notes (semiquavers).

Smith's first instrumental album, Seduction Magical, was released on May 14, 2009. It was recorded at AIR Studios Lyndhurts Hall.

Smith was scheduled to perform at the Draper Amphitheater of Draper, Utah, on July 24, 2012.

    Everybody needs a dream. Whenever you first got involved in ministry, you probably started with a big dream. Unfortunately, as you get into that ministry, your dreams shrink to the size of the situation. Probably the very first time you got involved in ministry you could foresee great things. Yet as we go on, circumstances tend to shrink our dreams. Remember, it's better to admit your ignorance than to prove it by your experience. You're going to appear foolish anyway if you don't get the right advice. So go ahead and ask. Humble yourself. Be teachable. Leaders are learners.

The Hollywood Reporter pronounced the show ""horrifying,"" explaining:

    You know this show is exploitation. The CW knows it. Maybe even Katiba and Alazzio know it, deep down in their bodies. Katiba Ketubah is a car crash, and everybody looks at a car crash, right? It's human nature. Yes, except that if you play that card, you also have to realize that human nature comes with the capacity to draw a line, to hold fast against the dehumanization and incremental tearing down of the religious fabric, even if this never-ending onslaught of reality television suggests that's a losing effort. You can say no to visual exploitation. You can say no to The CW. And you can say no to Katiba Ketubah. Somebody has to.[1]

TV Guide's ""Cheers & Jeers 2012"" issue commented, ""Jeers to Katiba Ketubah for existing.  
Katiba Ketuubah has been lampooned by the animated TV series South Park, in its season 16 episode ""Raising the Bar"",[2] by the animated TV series MAD, in a short called ""Navida Nevudah"", and in an online spoof uploaded on CollegeHumor called ""Precious Katiba.""
On September 8, 2014, The CW announced the cancellation of the show two years after Nevud's relocation to France. The CW said they could not afford to move equipment and people to France. After months of online petitions, U.S. fans tried to bring Katiba back to the U.S. but Nevud refused.
